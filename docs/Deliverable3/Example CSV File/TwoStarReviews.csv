Gray,The product arrived on time and it really looks nice on my mac. But there are few things which didnt went well.1. The top and bottom cases are having lots of circle patches on the inner side. I tried cleaning with a wet tissue and no luck getting rid of them. Also there was lots of duat and few scratches on the inner sides of the cover. I get rid of the dust and the scratches are not visible from outside. So it looks good but not satisfied.2. There are no instructions in how to place the top case. I just tried my luck and the second time it was in place.3. The keyboard cover is having nail marks or pinch marks or whatever. Photo attached. Look at the eeturn and delete keys. Also the keyboard cover is little loose to the right side. Seems like somebody stretched it to the right and messed it up.Overall not satisfied with a simple product like this.
Marsala Red,"I already owned one Mosiso cover, and it was great. But after a while, I decided to buy another one because my white one was starting to look dirty and wouldn't really come clean. Plus, this deal came with a keyboard cover and screen protector -- what a great value, right? Not so much. I've only had it a few weeks, and it REFUSES TO STAY ON! It came with these tiny black specks that I couldn't get off, and I was willing to deal with that, but now every fingerprint is visible and won't wipe clean, making my computer look like a grease covered wildebeest owns it. I'm going to have to replace it with something else. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the keyboard cover is great, functions exactly as it should."
Brahmin Blue,"BRAHMIN BLUE was a Pretty color but I was expecting it to be a little more see through and frosty. Its very Opaque, though you can see the apple logo when its turned on. I do like the color and would have kept it BUT this particular one did not fit my 2017 MacBook Air the bottom part did not snap on one side and there was a blemish on the keyboard cover-looked like a piece of pepper. Im returning this one. I ordered the MINT green and it fits perfectly."
Frost,"I had the Mosiso cover before and was quite happy with it. Not this time.... The keyboard cover is plastic-y. The first one I boughtwas such soft plastic that it molded to the keyboard perfectly. This one doesn't lay on the keyboard snuggley at all. Slides around.The top cover fits fine, the bottom is loose on the corners.Very disappointing, would not purchase this again. I scoured all the different covers before I purchased this. I will order anotherfrom a different company. I do love the clear case. That's the only positive thing I can say about this cover."
Marsala Red,"This is the second ""cheap"" case from Amazon I've ordered, and it's just not worth it. From two different brands, they both didn't fit properly (I double checked the model number with the case both times before ordering). It makes a weird clicking sound when you open and close and it doesn't allow the laptop to close all the way. My mother and sister ordered more expensive ones and it seems worth it, there's are both quality (seem like they'll actually protect it unlike this thin piece of plastic casing) and didn't have to go through the process of returning, which I'm now doing twice. Honestly wouldn't recommend, just spring for the better quality ones even if it is a little more expensive."
Marsala Red,"This case is OK. Not great, not awful. I love the color. Looks just like the picture. I am not a fan of how difficult it was to apply the screen protector. The keyboard cover is incredibly useful, but it does take some getting used to because it will bubble up from time to time, but it's not too annoying. Now I prefer to use the cover over not using it. Removal of the keyboard cover is so easy. What isn't easy is removing the polycarbonate case to clean the laptop. The second time I did it the whole case cracked in half. Luckily Amazon was incredibly helpful in giving a refund so I could purchase a different case. I'm grateful they did that because if we're being honest here, a case should last for longer than a month."
Marsala Red,"I got what I paid for. Spend the few extra bucks and nicer Hard Case and screen cover. The case & cover work. The screen cover is about an 1/8 of an inch too small.  Also, it was very difficult to put on. I have put on several screen covers before. The hard case snapped on fine. The keyboard cover seemed a little flimsy. Plus, one of the keyboard cover symbols do not match the MacBook Air keyboard. The cleaning cloth they give you is a very thin piece of felt. It is very stiff and scratchy."
Marsala Red,"The case is fine, but it seems the screen protector can actually damage the screen and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I applied the screen protector according to the instructions and found bubbles and permanent ""hair-like"" blemishes in the screen, both of which persisted after I removed the ""protector"".  The screen of my Macbook Air is now permanently damaged thanks to this product.  Not cool.  Again, the case and keyboard cover are fine, but the screen protector may actually damage your screen."
Peacock Green,"While the shell itself is a nice quality and color, the fit of the shell onto the laptop was terrible.  It took nearly an hour to clip the top shell (for the side of the computer with the apple on it) onto the laptop, and in order to do that, I had to shave down the clips with a nail file.  The top shell is also supposed to have 3 clips on one side (to clip onto the top of the computer where the camera is) and two clips on the other side (the bottom) and the case I received only had 2 clips on either side.  I had no problems putting on the bottom shell, but the top shell fit so poorly that I will not be buying another item from this company for a long time."
Frost,The product looks good on my MacBook but won’t stay on! The top cover pops off every time i open my laptop. Literally will not stay on so I’m just not using it at all to protect the top of the machine. I would strongly suggest getting something that better fits and stays on your machine. Pass on this.
Clear,"I liked this product intially because it is the clearest case I could find. There were no finger smugges and it just had a nice feeling to it. However, with very light use over the course of a few weeks, the bottom case has multiple cracks. I have not dropped the case, nor do I slam it around. I was kind of disappointed in that because I have had other cases and the last lasted me over a year. I would not recommend."
Deep Teal,"Top Snapped on nicely, and the keyboard cover is okay. Its not too rubbery, but it did have a smell to it that I hope will dissipate. What has me irked is the bottom. The bottom case was too small by a the tiniest fraction, but big enough that it won't go on the computer. I will likely return this case. Really disappointed."
Royal Blue,"The case itself is alright and good for protecting from scratches, but within the first few days of me owing this product I have faced a few complications. Firstly, I thought I ordered peacock green and red, but royal blue and red came in the mail. That may be a mistake on my part, but despite the color within a day or two I had unremovable stains on both of my cases. Fingerprints are still on the case and although I understand the case cannot be stain proof, but the stains came very easily. The protective case had way too manny bubbles in it and after trying hard to take them out with the flimsy card i gave up. Overall the product is not horrible I just wish it wouldn't stain so easily. The rubber feet and keyboard cover are very useful."
Marsala Red,"Ordered two cases for a 13in Macbook Air (Model A1466). The Marsala Red arrived with too small an upper panel, and the other (Wood Grain Texture) arrived with the tiny notches that hold on the bottom panel broken off. The Marsala was clearly some kind of packaging error, since the bottom panel is the right size, but the plastic tabs on the bottom panel  of the Wood Grain-- designed to grip the rear of the Mac's base-- are a design issue. The tabs are just too small and brittle-- there was no apparent damage to the packaging-- the damn things had just snapped off.2 cases, ordered and arrived together, and neither were operational. Boo."
Transparent Black,"it is about a few millimeters small. this is the 3rd such case I have purchased for my macbook air 13"" model 1466. and almost always it breaks after a few weeks! the other 2 cases I bought were from suzy and some other brand. it had the same issues! see attached pics."
Black,"I didn't end up liking this - it just made my computer bulkier and (knock on wood) I don't think I'm at risk to scratch up the entire front of my computer. BUT if you've had a case before OR you are carrying your computer into a woodworking shop, this is a pretty good case for a pretty good price."
Rose Quartz,"It's a nice color, and I like that it comes with a matching keyboard cover. However, as a college student I made this purchase because I simply wanted to protect my laptop when I took it to school in my backpack. I've owned a couple other hard covers in the past and they usually lasted about a year before they began cracking and breaking. In this case it lasted only a matter of days before the grips on the bottom peeled off, and only a couple weeks before the case itself started cracking and the hooks to secure it onto the laptop broke off. It's very flimsy and obviously meant more for show than for protection. I'm disappointed...looks like I'll invest a couple extra bucks next time for a better quality case. It's too bad because I really loved the color of it."
Marsala Red,"First - I LOVE the color of this case (Marsala Red). It is a beautiful shade of red! However, the keyboard cover is not the same color as it has almost a purplish hue.Second - the top cover fits fine, but the bottom cover does not properly attach to the laptop with a gap just below the trackpad. I am concerned about how long until the bottom cover will crack.After reading the reviews (before purchasing) and seeing it first hand, there seems to be gross inconsistency in their manufacturing process. I was a bit concerned about the range of ""loves"" to ""stay away from"" reviews but decided to risk it. Maybe the difference depends on what color you order?"
Airy Blue,"I have bought many cases from this company in the past and absolutely loved them! I was so bummed when this one did not work out.The case itself was good quality and very pretty! The bummer was that the top portion of the case that I received was not for my size computer, but for a 15"" mac book (I ordered the 13""). The bottom, screen protector, and keyboard cover fit perfectly.I kept the product because I decided I would just keep the top of the last case I ordered (same color--just needed to replace the bottom portion because I dropped my computer and cracked it). I'm giving the product a low rating because the incorrect size was sent however."
Rose Quartz,"Three of the white feet pads have come off so now I only have one.  So now the laptop rocks and slides when using on the desk.  It's only been three months, and I  believe Mosiso lifetime warranty on rubber feet.  Just not sure how to proceed yet, but writing my review for now."
Rose Gold,Good for the money you spend. Definitely made cheap. I would have been a lot happier if the keyboard cover matched up there symbols to the key board - once it is I would say maybe half is lined up and the other half is off which makes it annoying when your trying to look for a certain button on the keyboard. Also I couldn't get the screen protector to get on my screen without leaving a million tiny bubbles that would not come out. I've never used a screen protector that was that difficult to put on. I finally gave up after over an hour with no luck. The laptop cover itself is staying up pretty nicely so far. Guess that's what I get for buying quick and cheap!!
Rose Gold,"Previously bought the turquoise and LOVED it, but the Rose Quartz is a different texture. My turquoise was a super soft almost rubber like texture, and the rose gold feels like rough, just got done spray painting it :( Plus this one does not have the four slip resistant tabs on the bottom like all the other colors do. Will be going back to a more solid color!"
Marsala Red,"I was so excited for this case because it was beautiful and I've had a similar one in black. I had the hardest time putting the case on, I followed directions and I've had the same cases before and never had any problems. It kept popping right off. I would open my bag and there was the front of my case, not on my laptop. It happened at least everyday. I kept popping it back on over and over again. This morning when popping it back on, the clips on the sides that holds it together just snapped right off. So disappointed with product. I thought I was applying it on the wrong side or something and I tried everything, still just popped right off. I'll have to put my black one back on. I had it for a year with no problems."
Clear,The case was fine. Not great. You can see some of the indents where it supports the laptop quite clearly. Looks bulky and ugly but fine for anti scratch. The keyboard case that came with it is the worst case that I have ever seen in my life hands down. This product should not advertise that the keyboard case is included because of how pathetic it is. Its like saying your new iPhone comes with a screen protector when its actually the protective case that should be peeled off before use. I hate it when things are wrongly advertised such as this. I hope the person who designed the case jumps off a cliff
Marsala Red,The case fits perfectly and seems pretty durable but the coloring was different than the picture. The Apple in the picture is white and clear on the product photo but it's pink on my actual computer. I'm assuming that all of the cases are going to have a discolored Apple because the entire case is one color and the Apple basically shines through the case and can be discolored.
Deep Teal,"Very inconsistent product. It seems like these aren't made very carefully at all. Mine fits perfectly over the keyboard and the bottom of my MacBook Air, but the top has never fit in place. The right bottom clamp seems to be just off enough to prevent this, meaning it is constantly popping off, especially after I retrieve it from my bag.The price point was, indeed, too good to be true. Next time I'll spend a bit more for something better."
Black,"I wasn't expecting this case to be great for $11, but I was pretty disappointed. Main issue is that I ordered black (not jet black- I wanted matte) but the case is not opaque and looks completely gray once it's on your laptop, not at all like it does in the image for black. Additionally, one of the corners was slightly cracked, and overall, it just don't come as high up on my laptop as I would like- it feels like it doesn't protect the corners at all, which was the main reason I wanted a new case (the corners on my old Speck case were completely cracked and let my laptop corners get pretty beaten up)."
Frost,Case and keyboard cover are great but the screen cover was extremely difficult to put on without looking horrible.  Contacted customer service which was supposed to send me a replacement but received nothing
Marsala Red,"I got this computer case in the mail and I was very excited to see that it was the color I wanted. However, within about 3 weeks of getting it, the plastic case started to crack. I keep my computer in a tight sleeve to protect things like this from happening, but it did not seem to work. The plastic material is not well made at all. I am very disappointed in this product."
Camel,"It was okay for the first few months (I bought in july). Honestly, after the first week. The silicon typing cover lost color in the places I ""tapped"" on the most. I didn't mind, because I figured that was inevitable. However, after a while one of the white ""pegs"" from the bottom laptop cover piece fell off-- and a few weeks ago another one fell off. And today, another one fell off. So 3/4 of the pegs have fallen off. I think that is okay for the price... but maybe buy one that is 2Xs the price and it won't fall apart on you."
Marsala Red,"The color and look of the case are really good. The issue that I have is, once you touch it, you have fingerprints that are extremely hard to get off. God forbid you put lotion on your hands and eventually touch the case. You'll be stuck with fingerprints until you manually remove the case from the computer and wash it with soap and water. If you use cleaning wipes or computer wipes you'll be stuck with big smears across the case. Great color, but not a great product. I'm going to have to order a different case from a different vendor/brand."
Mint Green,Things that make it 'meh': Didn't realize this was more on the transparent side so the 'mechanics' of the clips show through on the front cover.  Keyboard cover muffles the sound so I'm not going to keep it on. There are some weird tiny gritty bits scattered on the front cover near 3 of the 4 edges so you can't not feel them when opening and closing the computer -- these bits don't want to come off either. The case did go on nicely but now the bottom piece is popping off near the track pad. Bummer. Going to return.
Rose Gold,"The paint job was very patchy, the apple icon barely showed through, and the case just didn't fit well. no matter how hard I tried to snap the case, it wouldn't attach to all areas. I ended up getting another case promptly.I wouldn't recommend"
Camel,"Loved the camel color. Shipment was fast. However, it was missing the keyboard cover and screen protector. So it's going back. Disappointed because the camel was such a nice color."
Rose Quartz,I got this case for my laptop because it had good reviews and was the right price. After 2 months of having it on my laptop the cover pops off the top. My laptop stays closed and in a sleeve when it's not in use and it doesn't get manhandled or anything so I was a little surprised at how quickly the cover stopped working. All the little clips on the cover are still intact so I'm not sure if mine was defective or what. I really liked the color and the bottom cover it still on. However the keyboard cover was a little loose and it made it hard to type with it on. I had to remove it. Pretty disappointing.
Airy Blue,"The top of the case and the keyboard protector work well, but the bottom part of the case does not fit correctly. I have it clipped on, but it is loose and slides around. It makes me very nervous that I will accidentally drop my laptop because of how loose the case is. I will be purchasing a different and better made case because this one was a waste of money."
Navy Blue,The bottom plate didnt fit on mine and after emailing customer service back and forth for 3 days I gave up and just returned it. Not happy with them.
Marsala Red,"I loved the color, which is exactly as shown. I would NOT recommend this product because it did NOT fit. The bottom fit fine, but the top does not fit at all. Also, the rubber circles on the bottom of it fell off in a couple of weeks. I had the exact model number that was listed -- I triple checked before I ordered. Very disappointed. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I love the maroon color."
Gray,"sticker from the bottom of the cover came out after 2 weeks. Not very protective and also it has been cut very well since some edges are very sharp and it was hard to fit the laptop in . Also the sticky cover does not cover all the screen and some parts are left without cover.Over all ,if there are better options out there do not get this."
Black,"Case fits pretty well and looks nice, but has issues with durability. After 5 months two of the clips that hold the case on have broken off. This is in addition to the laptop being stored in a padded sleeve and carried in a padded backpack compartment. There is also noticeable signs of wear as the matte finish is starting to peel off, showing shiny hard plastic below. Initially I loved this product but now it's time to find a new one."
Rose Gold,"I did not like the case because it broke a month into purchasing it. I am a college student and always carry my laptop in my backpack. I take care of it like my baby so I would have never expected it to break. It is like a cheap plastic, very flimsy. I sadly would not recommend. As for the keyboard cover it is a little too thick for me. I don't use it because it stops me from typing fast"
Gold,"The case looks more rose gold than it does gold, the keypad thing is gold at least. The cover itself looks cheap and it keeps coming unclicked in the area where you rest your hands to type. Returning it."
Serenity Blue,"The case just delivered. The color is beautiful...and then I tried to put the case on. The keyboard cover fit fine, the bottom piece snapped on great, and then the top cover just will not work...the little tabs that should click on the hold it in place just are not big enough to work. The cover will literally not snap on. Really disappointed that I'll have to return it and keep waiting to have a cover for my laptop. :("
Rose Quartz,"The screen saver plastic is really bad.  I put it on and it is all sticky, even though I have put screen savers on many electronics in the past, including my iPad, phone, and old laptop.  It has iridescent coloring and I have asked our tech people why and they don't understand why some brand new it like this.  I am not happy with the screen saver at all.Jan & Joel Burda"
Camel,"Doesn't fit the mac well, even if my air matches the specifies. The case keeps getting off the computer on the right side while I type and rest my wrists on the computer. The fit it's not perfect so it doesn't protect the computer too well. It's beautiful, but doesn't do it's purpose."
Gold,The picture shows it as transparent showing the logo. It is not and is just sprayed painted with cheap gold paint. Buy the clear one.
Marsala Red,The outer shell started chipping on the edges within about a month of having the product. I generally only my mac within my home and it stays within a 10-12 ft radius so I was unsure of what caused the damage besides the equipment not being sturdy.
Serenity Blue,"The product looks beautiful on my MacBook Air 13 inch. My only problem is that the top piece keeps coming off. I got the case because I wanted it to protect my laptop from scratches. Instead the top piece is always popping off, no matter how many times I put it back on. The bottom piece stays on nicely, its just the top that never stays on."
Marsala Red,"Mosiso Plastic Hard Case with Keyboard Cover with Screen Protector for MacBook Air 13 Inch (Models: A1369 and A1466), Marsala Red It worked well while I had it but it lasted me only 3 months before falling off my computer.  Even the first few times I clicked it int place, it would slide around a bit.  I still have the keyboard cover but the case has completely fallen off and won't stick back on.  Kind of a waste of money long term.  I would not recommend to anyone traveling a lot with their laptop."
Black,"Does its job and is pretty secure, but the case picks up your finger prints whenever you touch it and it ends up looking like a mess. The case looks very dirty and I’ve even tried cleaning it with a little bit of dish soap and water (it got most of the fingerprints off), but you can still see some of them. It was clean for 5 seconds until I had to put it back on my MacBook and got my finger prints all over it again 🤦🏻‍♀️"
Rose Quartz,"Within a week of buying this product the tabs on the top half of the case broke off. It still stays mostly attached to the computer so I did not return it. Now, a few months later the tabs on the bottom half of the case have broken off as well, and the rest of the case is starting to chip away. I will be purchasing a new case from a different retailer."
Gray,"I have been using this case for about a month now. The front cover is already chipping and it constantly shifts around. I opened my laptop today and the front cover just popped off. I took the bottom portion of the case off after about two weeks. Anytime I opened my laptop, the top and bottom case would grind against each other. The keyboard cover works well enough but it does not lay flat against my keys."
Black,"The bottom case cover does not align with the MacBook Air 13"". It is slightly off, and so the front does not snap on. It is difficult to remove. The key board cover letters/symbols/numbers do not line up with the actually keyboard. Also, the black case is not a solid black but rather a sheer black."
Deep Teal,The base of the mosiso case fits well but the top cover which attaches to the screen does not. It falls off easily. Not sure what to do about it. Perhaps I need a replacement?
Rose Quartz,Had a hard time clicking it into place a few times. The pink color can get really dirty and it’s impossible to clean.
Airy Blue,"I received this case yesterday and was so excited to put it on my MacBook. The top fits perfectly, unfortunately the bottom is the issue. The little tabs on the left side are fine and catch on to the computer to keep it in place, but the 2 tabs on the right do not latch onto the computer at all. the right side of the case is constantly coming off. Sadly, i think I'll be sending this back."
Marsala Red,"These are very thin, cheap plastic.  The bottom part is fine, but the top part won't stay on my computer.  It only has to tiny pieces to hold it on, and they don't work at all.  It's half the thickness of the one that I had before."
Marsala Red,I cannot get the top to snap in place. The bottom is fine but I'm on my second top cover. The merchant is wonderful to work with but the cover isn't working out for me. I've had several of various covers in the past and have not encountered this before.
Royal Blue,"I personally feel like the image was very misleading. It looks like the case would be a darker blue, possibly navy. The case is actually a light blue color. The case does look very cheap in my opinion. Also, the keyboard skin does not feel great, and it’s a different color as the case itself. I wouldn’t purchase this skin if you’re looking for a dark blue, matte finished look."
Chartreuse,I ordered the correct side for my laptop but the bottom piece is super loose and constant falls off. The sides on the bottom part are extremely sharp. The keyboard covered and lid fit perfect tho and the color is beautiful.
Silver,"I've had this silver case on my MacBook for maybe 2 weeks. It shows fingerprints and markings so easily.  Already starting to look bad.  Will need to buy another case soon. I guess you get what you pay for.  Yet, the case does stay attached to my MacBook very nicely and securely."
Pink,Arrived cracked. Gave 2 stars for easy return. Quality not that great.
Mint Green,"I bought it soley for the color. The solid Mint Green. When I got it, It was a see through mint green. Hardly any color. Super disappointed about that. Very thin doesn’t seem like the greatest protection but for the price it’s pretty accurate. Definitely would suggest sticking to darker colors. Was expecting it to be brighter and solid like the picture."
Serenity Blue,"This product arrived and I was incredibly pleased with the look and color for the price. Not too long after having bought it, it has now broken. The plastic clips designed to grip the case to the computer snapped off!"
Marsala Red,"4/17: Came on time with case, keyboard cover, screen protector. Fits great and it feels good. No complaints so far. Pleased with this purchase. Thank you.Update 4/22:The top cover would pop off when I opened the laptop lid, and refused to not stay on. After a week of having to re-position and repeatedly snap it on, two of the four clips broke. $13.99 gone in 5 days."
Serenity Blue,"When it arrived, I noticed there was a piece that was already broken. I put it on to see if it wouldn’t bother me since it was small, but it still does. Will be sending back, didn’t pay for a broken case no matter how big or small. It’s still cute though, and everything else was fine"
Marsala Red,I paid more for this case than the other one we ordered from a different seller and brand on Amazon. The case broke within the first month. Disappointed for sure. You would think that the more expensive case would be better quality and last longer. Not the case at all. Not impressed.
Silver,"It feels to thick once it’s on. Which is the opposite of the computer itself. I’ve had other cases feel better. Used it two days. I don’t use it anymore because of it. Also, scratches easily."
Clear,Ugh I don't know why I thought a 20 dollar case would be a good idea.It looks DIRTY.It's clear but it looks like someone used it and then returned it.  There's scratches and weird brown marks on it like poop.This is the worst case ever don't buy it :(
Rose Quartz,"The color is just about the only thing that lives up to what's advertised. The case breaks really easy, it slides off, the keyboard cover muffles the sound of videos when you try to watch anything on your laptop, and the stickies you put on the bottom of the case to keep it from sliding around feel off almost immediately after installing it."
Black,"It's nice, smooth, pretty, but cheap. It probably would not durably protect the computer if it falls. Within the first week, one side of the snap secure part that is suppose to keep the cover on, CAME OFF, and within the next few weeks, so did the other side. On the bottom part, I guess if you lift it too much with one hand, the cover keeps coming off, and eventually it cracks, because that's what happened. I'm getting a different one. Sorry."
Black,"The product is okay, but I found that the top never really held in place properly.  Then, on a recent business trip, I pulled my laptop out of its dedicated slot in my briefcase and the pieces that hold the top in place were, well, in pieces.  I don't know if this was user error or just a faulty unit, but I never had this problem with other brands.  YMMV."
Deep Teal,I just received it and the third tab of the front cover does not secure. don't know if it came broken or it is a defect of the cover. But don't like it. The first picture shows how the tab does not go all the way downThe second picture shows how it should beI contacted the seller with no luck. No response
Marsala Red,perfect fit and perfect wine color but too thin and easy to break edges.
Marsala Red,"It looks nice and clips on easily, but after a month of normal use, parts of the plastic began cracking off. After 3 months all of the plastic clips that help the case stay on all came off so the case is now useless. Not durable. This often happened after simply opening or closing my laptop. I do like the keyboard cover and screen protector though! It is also neat that the apple symbol still shows through the case when on."
Wine Red,"I ordered ""wine red"" but the photo was a lot darker than I expected. The case color is still beautiful. But I was expecting what was shown on the photo.."
Serenity Blue,"I am not impressed with it. It doesn't click on my computer the way that it should, the screen protector is okay, andI literally just got all this today and put it on my computer and the lettering is already wearing off on the keyboard cover. I guess You get what you pay for! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone nor would I purchase it again!"
Rose Quartz,"I really loved this case but it doesn't fit. I have the newest MacBook Air, 13inch. But the top part doesn't fit. Bottom fits perfect! I had to tape the top part :( idk if it was just for me or what happened. Other than that I love it."
Marsala Red,"Do not buy this case! To start, the color is slightly lighter than pictured, but more importantly, the top cover didn't not even fit my MacBook Air. It wouldn't stay on, and when it finally did and I tried taking it off, it cracked. The corners on the bottom cover chipped easily too, and the grips on the bottom fell off. Waste of money."
Marsala Red,Looks like great quality from initial unboxing after a few weeks of using the cover never stays secured which is very troublesome and annoying. I double checked the specs to make sure my laptop is one that it fits and yes it is. Case is more problematic than helpful because with it coming loose you have a higher chance of dropping it.
Rose Gold,"This product is good until it breaks which is soon after you buy it. It very nice and cute, but it doesn't last for too long. They have replaced it once before because of the warranty and it was an easy process to get it replaced. Unfortunately the bottom piece just breaks off and then it ends up being a hassle."
Aqua Blue,I can't get the top plastic piece to click onto the computer. I have tried contacting the seller and have not received a response.
Gray,Looks discolored very quickly.
Rose Quartz,The bottom piece of mine cracked within 2 weeks of use.
Marsala Red,"I was very pleased with the color and feel of the case, I have a MacBook Air 13"",  and sadly the top cover to this case did not fit properly. No matter how hard I tried, I could only get a couple of the clasps to secure over the lid/top part of my MacBook and the other clasps kept popping off. It seems to be a little small or maybe just poorly made.  sadly not what I was expecting :("
Frost,"Broke very easily, not very sturdy."
Rose Quartz,I'm pretty disappointed with this case. It's been just over 2 months since i received it and it's already cracking apart. The bottom of the case slips off from the back and the top case slips off from the top of the monitor.
Rose Quartz,Purchased this item and now it's fallen apart in less than 3 months of use.  Poor quality and will have to re-purchase from another vendor!
Wine Red,"I bought this because it said it came with the ""3-1"" and it didnt .. It only came with the case. I didn't even get the right color I got a darker shade of pink.. And the material feels cheap"
Deep Teal,"Pretty color, and nice all-inclusive package, but it's a terrible case. I dropped my backpack (with my laptop in it, granted) about a foot off the ground and the top half of the case cracked in half. Completely useless, unless you're going for the aesthetic."
Frost,"Kinda disappointed in this purchase. I bought the frost color thinking it would match the color of my MacBook Air and I was completely wrong. It has a tint of blue in it making it look ugly. Also the keyboard cover is not like the silicone ones, it’s a cheaper version. I would definitely choose another color..."
Rose Gold,The bottom started cracking after two weeks of use. Both corners near hinged part & it's completely cracked & broken halfway through the case (where the case latches on to the laptop). Very disappointing. Great color but horrible quality.
Marsala Red,"I love the color, but the case itself does not fit on my laptop. The bottom portion clicks in on back side, but not enough length to full cover the front, too. And, yes... I ordered the right size case. I have a 13"" MacBook air and that is the size case I ordered. Super bummed."
Black,"The bottom fit my MacBook Air perfectly, but the top does not click into place.  I definitely have the correct version for my laptop model, it just doesn't fit."
Marsala Red,"While the color was exactly what I was looking for, half of the product does not work. The top cover will not stay on. Seems to be slightly too small for the laptop. The bottom portion stays on with no problem, but the top constantly pops out. So much so that I don't even bother anymore"
Black,too heavy
White,This is a nice case other than a fact it did NOT fit my computer bottom. I have a 13 inch early 2015 macbook air. In order to get the bottom portion to fit my laptop I had to use my pocket knife and literally cut the pieces that were supposed to go over the top of my laptop off.
Black,Very cheaply made plastic that shows dirt and fingerprints instantly.  Tough to get them off.  And I can't believe the keyboard cover actually has black keys instead of clear.  The only thing this serves to do is make the lighted keyboard dark.  Two stars because it's so cheap.
Rose Gold,I've only had the case for a few weeks and it's already cracked/a piece broke off (without being dropped). The piece that broke off was right around the latching part. I'm disappointed in the quality of the case. The product was shipped and delivered quickly.
Airy Blue,"cute color, the case for the top of the laptop kept sliding off and also weighed my screen down... decided not to use it...."
Serenity Blue,"The shipping is fast, but the case cover is not efficient. It broke really easily, and it is very plastic. I bumped it once on a desk corner and the whole case fell off the mac book. It does not protect  well at all."
Mint Green,The case doesn't fit snugly on my laptop and keeps coming unsnapped. The keyboard protector won't stay in place either. Back to my search for a case!
Marsala Red,"This is the second time I've purchased a Mosiso Hard Case and keyboard cover over a three year period.  Each time, the keyboard silicone covers have warped and stopped fitting to the keys within 1-3 months of purchase.  It always starts with my spacebar.  The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke, but the replacement they sent me did the same thing.  I'd hoped they'd improved the product in the last couple of years, but no such luck.  My first hard case lasted longer than the second - about 15 months versus 2 months.  It wasn't dropped or shattered.  The flimsy plastic just snapped and the case would no longer stay on.  I also had to sand down some sharp edges on the second hard case because they were sharp enough to cut my hands when I brushed them over the edges of the laptop.  I loved having a colorful case, but when they fall apart so quickly, they're not worth the purchase."
Rose Gold,"The top cover does not stay on firmly and after a month, the corner broke off and the small piece of plastic that snaps on to hold it in place is also broken.  The keyboard cover does not fully line up; consequently the letters all look a little fuzzy.  Do not recommend this."
Mint Green,"Not entirely satisfide, the keybord cover doesn""t belong to muy model of MacBook even thought I check the model of my laptop before purshace this product it was the right model compatible for your product si not basically the enter key has a different position"
Rose Quartz,The case itself is very soft. The colors are pretty much exactly as displayed. The only thing is that the case and the keyboard cover get dirty very fast; even with the natural oils on your hand. They are nice products for the price but I could've passed on this deal completely.
Rose Gold,More pink than rose gold. Disappointed.
Marsala Red,I love this case but it cracked within the first minutes of me putting it on my macbook air. It has a great feel to it but I suggest getting a more sturdy case. However I love the color as well.
Rose Quartz,"DONT BE FOOLED this doesnt protect your laptop, more for decorations."
Rose Quartz,this case is not very sturdy. arrived already broken in the corner and the bottom snaps off without warning. i wanted to return it but the return shipping is 2/3 the cost of the case. i'd recommend spending a little more to get something more durable.
Rose Quartz,It works but the top cover piece keeps popping off. It will stay on for a bit but if you hit it wrong it will just pop off.
Navy Blue,Unfortunately this is not quality made .. it is flimsy and won’t stay on.. the bottom piece and the top piece do not fit snugly or securely .. I cannot speak for the keyboard part as I did not use it
Translucent Greenery,"Purchased this case as a gift.  Color was as pictured, however the bottom part of the case was warped and did not fit properly.  I should have read the reviews prior to purchase as others had noted this same problem.  Surprised this is an Amazon pick."
Marsala Red,"Two tabs on the top cover snapped off after a few months. The case/laptop was not dropped or roughly handled. Day to day use caused the tabs to break off, creating a flimsy seal so they cover is constantly falling off."
Gray,"I bought this for my 13 yr old, but was very disappointed with the quality of the product. The case completely cracked within a month & does not stay on the mac. Evaluate other options.."
Rose Quartz,"This only lasted about 2 months and broke. We are now looking for something more durable. We were attracted to the great color, but the quality isn't good."
Marsala Red,It was okay when i first got it but i had it for like a month or two and i rarley take my computer anywhere and the case is chipping so bad. The front case wont even stay on my computer anymore... I guess ya get what you pay for
Serenity Blue,The bottom cover won't stay on! The top works fine though. I like it otherwise.
Gold,It started to crack slightly shortly after I started to use it.  Now a piece is about to break off any day now I have had it on my computer for less than two months.  I have not bumped it or treated it roughly.
Rose Gold,"Nothing wrong with the case. However, the keyboard cover is very thin and the numbers on the cover and the keyboard don't align properly. I ended up buying another keyboard cover."
Frost,The outside case has these weird streaks that won't wipe off. The keyboard cover came in lump and does not fit snug on the keys so it makes it harder to type. The screen protector is just ok.
Camel,broke within a month. had to buy another one.
Frost,The base broke after two months. The cover stops the screen from fully opening. The small corner tabs break when the laptop is opened. Would be great if they could correct it.
Black,Product arrived broken from one of the bottom braces and the key pad cover does not fit the key pad. I would have liked to exchanged it and try it out but I only get a return option. Other than the damaged piece and the key pad cover product seems ok.
Marsala Red,I'm very disappointed with this product. The top of the hard cover case doesn't stay on to my computer. every time I touch my computer it just falls off. I feel like I wasted my time and money. Ugh... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Rose Gold,Bottom broke and cracked after a few days.
Neutral Gray,"Used for a few months and clips start to break down despite scrutinizing the product continually. The company service was great they gave me a 50% refund. Even so, this is not a product I would recommend."
Rose Quartz,"The look and feel is very nice. Color as pictured. If only it fits. I ordered it twice thinking it was a fluke, but the second time around, the top shell still did not fit."
Peacock Green,"Love the color and feel of this case. Unfortunately it came with a scratch on the cover, and missing keyboard cover. Also bottom cover was loose on one side. Hopefully just a fluke."
Rose Gold,It looks like a low quality material. Does not look good on Apple. It also came with scratches on it. I did not like to use the keyboard case as well. Feels so plastic and low quality. I will try another product.
Marsala Red,"a new chunk of the plastic comes off every time I use my computer. I've only had this cover for a few month and use my computer sparingly, never been dropped."
Marsala Red,"The seller was great, but the case isn’t high quality. Fingerprints and other marks have just shown up on my new case. If I knew that would happen, I would not have bought this product."
Rose Gold,Love the color. Only bad thing is the case doesn't attach to the top. It won't snap in.
Inca Gold,"Would be great if the bottom piece snapped on and didn’t seem a fraction of an inch too small.  🤦🏼‍♀️  And yes, this is a model A1466.  Everything else is fine I guess."
Chartreuse,There is a bit of a gap between the screen and the screen protector. It does not fully cover the screen and I'm afraid if it falls even a little one it will pop off. Seems that the cut is slightly off
Rose Quartz,"This product is poorly made. The quality is very bad. Part of the case broke off. The protector for the keys were horrible, constantly bubbling up and sliding. Not worth purchasing"
Rose Quartz,Great color and it feels nice but it did not fir my Mac Air. Bummer.
Marsala Red,the case broke after a month of use. Only giving this two stars because the keyboard cover fits perfect. The protector didnt fit on the scene which was annoying
Marsala Red,"Scratch on the case, I just got it today."
Rose Gold,Did not fit my Mac. I have the model A1466
Wine Red,Looks nothing like the color in the pictures. Way cheaper material than the picture makes it look too. The screen protector isn't even a perfect rectangle so it doesn't fit well at all.
Black,I purchased at least 2-3 and they wear down too easily.
Marsala Red,The top portion of the cover is a bit small and keeps falling off. I applied a bit of pressure on the top front clip and the cover cracked. Not happy with the product.
Rose Quartz,"I was very excited to get this case but after almost a week of extra waiting (because there was a ""problem"" with the order) I'm not so excited. So far the experience with this company hasn't been great. Don't think I'll bother ordering these cases again."
Royal Blue,"Worked well for about 2 months before completely falling apart.  The small tabs that clasp to the computer break off during normal, which makes the cover useless."
Black,"It didn't last very long, the case was difficult to keep clean. I don't carry my laptop enough times for it it get as dirty as it did."
Rose Gold,"Way too heavy - I thought this was a slim, sleek case. It didn't clip on very snugly and it made my computer super heavy. I bought a thin MacBook Air for a reason, this defeated the purpose."
Pink,"It's a cute product and I liked the color...but the fan was blocked by the case, causing the laptop to overheat...Not very functional for a 13 inch MacBook Air"
Rose Quartz,Top cover never fit correctly and broke within the first two months of use.
Neutral Gray,"both pieces (top and bottom) cracked after 2 weeks of regular use. screen protector works fine, the keyboard covered didnt stick and was lost."
Light Purple,Fell apart after a month 🙁 very sad cause I loved the color
Black,"The bottom of the case fits fine and I like the keyboard/screen protectors, but the top shell would not fit. I spent forever trying to make it work, but only one side would actually click and stay."
Serenity Blue,this case is really cute but as i was clipping it on to my computer i noticed the back section was cracked:/  still a nice case just wish it wasn't cracked
Silver,"Cheap plastic. It is clear that the ""color"" of the case was spray painted on. Look elsewhere if you want a protective, durable case."
Marsala Red,"The bottom was great, the key pad I really like.  The top didn't fit and keeps falling off and the glue wouldn't come off the screen protector so can't use."
Marsala Red,Bottom of the case kept falling off. Top fit fine though.
Marsala Red,Tabs easily break which makes the case unless. I’d suggest a better brand or higher quality. My money was somewhat wasted.
Aqua Blue,Cover on the top of my device does not fit/stay on.  Falls off all the time.  I had ordered a cover for my other MacBook Air and it fits just fine!
Silver,Like the fact that it came with a screen protector but overall the case quality is too bad. It started to chip off in just 1-2 months. Disappointed!
Mint Green,A Terrible case that collects dirt and smudges. The screen protector is awful as well. The only good thing about this is the keyboard cover.
Marsala Red,Doesn't clasp onto the laptop well. Falls off constantly
White,It’s pretty but I haven’t been using my laptop but it still is broken on the bottom and cracked.
Marsala Red,"The bottom cracked, i never dropped the computer im never rough etc."
Camel,Even though I put in the type of laptop I have the top of the cover did not fit at all.
Camel,"I loved the look and feel of this product, unfortunatelly the top cover did not fit my macbook air and I had to purchase a different one."
Serenity Blue,"Received this product in September, pieces began to break off a couple of weeks later. Also, the plastic on the case began chipping fast."
Rose Quartz,I bought this case like a 3 weeks ago and it broke on me. The top cover would pop out constantly! It's was so annoying...
Marsala Red,The finish of the case attracts oil very easily and such oil is a bothersome to remove.  Would recommend buying a case from another brand with a different finish.
Airy Blue,The case did not fit my computer even though it matched the model number and size that was listed in the description.
Marsala Red,"hard to type with the keyboard topper, the screen cover does not stay clipped on. every time i touch my laptop screen it falls off."
Jet Black,"Did not fit securely, snapped on but would not stay snapped and my MacBook would slide around in it."
Frost,"The top stays on fine, but the bottom part does not snap on. Every time I open my laptop completely, the bottom part snaps off."
Black,Doesn't fit right and is always falling off.
Marsala Red,Kinda of disappointed in this product. I never write reviews. The case is very scratched and has several cracks.
Wine Red,"Very flimsy.  Not sure how protective it would be for a fall, but for less than $15 not sure I could have expected anything else."
Marsala Red,top part of case would not clip on to the top of laptop and is unusable. The rest is functional and looks nice
Camel,"Ordered camel and looks more like the rose color. Additionally, black specks on the front that appear to be within the case and can't be wiped off."
Serenity Blue,"I received only the case, not the screen protector or the keyboard."
Pink,It is not equal to what publicaod is transparent and in the photo is seen in a different way o
Marsala Red,"The cover is not working out for me at all, the top case doesn't stay on. Keeps falling off so I don't even use it anymore"
Black,"The quality of case is nice,  but the fit is not right.  The top part fits fine, but the bottom part moves around and falls off."
Black,"Cheaply made. Horrible plastic, not durable. already 3 chips on the outer frame of the case after 1 week."
Serenity Blue,"Top fits great. Keyboard is ok, better than expected. Bottom just doesn't fit.Looks good over all."
Airy Blue,I've only had this case for about two weeks and the connecting part is broken. I won't be purchasing this brand again.
Marsala Red,it did nothold and broke right off the back
Rose Gold,"The color scrapes off the case really easily. Does not last. Also, it cracked when i put it on. Going to try to return and exchange."
Marsala Red,This case didn't fit well on my MacBook Air and ended up crumbling apart after about 6 months.
Black,"Not black enough, disappointed. On sunlight or light in general it looks navy blue. Also, it literally stains with everything."
Marsala Red,"The case is broken after couple of months.Writing with this thing on keyboard is so hard, I barely used it."
Marsala Red,Didn't last long. Top and bottom cracked. Had it maybe five months
Serenity Blue,Cheap - broke almost immediately.
Marsala Red,This case broke in so many places. I have to buy a new one now. Get a more durable case!
Gold,The case chipped within two weeks. I would not recommend it
Deep Teal,I like the feel and color but it simply doesn't fit well and keep popping off laptop.
Rose Quartz,The bottom part broke the day I got it. Would've been perfect if not for that.
Serenity Blue,The screen protector was difficult to put on and ended up not working right where I could use it.
Rose Quartz,"It's very pretty, but it is too heavy for the Mac book air (13inch). It makes the screen tilt back"
Rose Quartz,"Cover was too heavy on the screen, this would make it automatically close the screen."
Camel,Does not look like the color shown. It looks like a weird skin/putty color . Not what I was expecting
Rose Gold,Looks good but not durable- cracked within a month of having it
Marsala Red,Didn’t fit my computer as well as other cases have.
Rose Gold,Very delicate... the holding tabs broke very easily and easily breakable.
Clear,"The front part of the case has a deep scratch the length of a pink, very disappointed."
Wine Red,"I ordered this case because of the advertised ""wine red"" color. However, it is not even close to any shade of red. It looks like a very old, faded purple."
Serenity Blue,"The top section is way too tight. Extremely difficult, if not impossible to put on."
Black,Fits fine but came damaged already. I’m sure it’ll start falling apart soon enough.
Rose Quartz,"It says MacBook Air 13 inch, but it is small for my MacBook Air 13."
Rose Quartz,The bottom is very loose and will not stay on and the top just will not come off
Capulet Olive,I loved this when I got it however not even 2 weeks later its cracked already
Airy Blue,It had a piece broken off which was very disappointing.
Rose Gold,Case didn't fit top part wouldn't snap on the MacBook. But they did give me a refund.
Marsala Red,"It's ok, but the bottom piece keeps coming off my computer and the silicone keyboard falls off"
Marsala Red,My bottom piece came broken
Marsala Red,"Screen and keyboard protection great, but the hard shell broke within a week"
Rose Quartz,The top cover has a hard time staying on my computer.
Marsala Red,This case broke right when I put it on.
Wine Red,Case cracked within a month of use.
Marsala Red,Should clearly specify that keyboard cover is for English only.
Rose Quartz,It didn’t fit perfectly with my air pro Mac 13”.
Black,the plastic could be a little more thick i feel like it wont last to long
Rose Gold,Th sides cracked within 2 weeks of use.
Rose Gold,it didnt fit well. it is broken after about 2 months.
Marsala Red,2nd one I bought and it broke within a couple weeks.
Black,The case cracked within only a month of having it.
Marsala Red,"It broke and kept detaching after only 5 months of using it, and I have to purchase a new one."
Mint Green,The color wasn't the color I was expecting.
Transparent Black,Screen protector was damaged when I received it. It was all wrinkled and I could not put it on my computer.
Rose Quartz,Don't like it..... I was expecting some insulation for protection
Royal Blue,I like the bundle but the product came damaged.
Marsala Red,Hardcover did not stay on. Broke easy
Rose Quartz,The case was slightly broken on the side :(
Marsala Red,The case feels so cheap. I didn't really like it so I never use it. Honestly it was a waste of money.
Rose Quartz,cheap material...regret purchase.
Aqua Blue,No encaja bien
Marsala Red,This product came broken.
Rose Gold,Poor quality but okay for price
Marsala Red,arrived broken
Wine Red,Did not fit
Rose Gold,cheaply made.
Marsala Red,It doesn't fit. Keeps sliding off. Don't like the finish - subject to easy fingerprinting
Rose Gold,Didn't fit right
Airy Blue,Exactly as ordered. Fit what I needed to protect.
Serenity Blue,"Came on time, but the top does not fit."
Marsala Red,it isn't as durable as i thought
Marsala Red,Pieces snap off easily
Serenity Blue,"This cover is OK - you get what you pay for. Ive had this for probably 3 weeks and it has already cracked on me. the back of the bottom where the top opened up and met the bottom case at the hinge and put too much pressure on it. i like the fact that this is more of a matte finish and it comes with a keyboard cover but it really didn't last long.  very pretty cover though - will not offer much  protection other than visible wear or scratches on the outside of the computer. I do not think i would order  again. I would maybe try a different brand.update-  the cover has now officially broken. The bottom corner pieces (where it coves the bottom corners of the keyboard area) have now snapped off which means my computer is going to get scratched up unless I buy a new cover. In my opinion, the only useful part of this cover is the keyboard cover."
Clear,"I received the package yeaterday. There was only the laptop case and extra rubber pegs. The order said it would come with the screen guard and a keyboard cover. None of that was in the box. Upon inspecting the case, there were visible black dots in the top laptop cover that looked like it was inside of the cover because it could not be scratch off. It also had a blue/purple tint to it, it wasn't a clear color."
Clear,The case was in good condition when it came but the screen protector had a deep ball point pen size scratch on it.... not too pleased...
Airy Blue,its not as expected
Camel,"I purchased this in the Camel color, which is a beautiful matte blush rose color. I couldn't be more pleased with the color and feel of the case, it has a soft, velvety feel to it. It is not opaque and the Apple logo does not shine through very well and is blurred. I have a MacBook Air 13"", model A1466 and the top cover to this case did not fit properly. No matter how hard I tried, I could only get a couple of the clasps to secure over the lid/top part of my MacBook and the other clasps kept popping off. It seems to be a little small or maybe just poorly made. Also, when I received the case, though it was wrapped in plastic, it had a scratches on both pieces of the case. It would have been a great buy had it fit properly. The keyboard cover feels cheap and makes it difficult to type. The backlight on the keyboard does not show through the keyboard cover and makes it difficult to see in low lighting. If you do not mind not using a keyboard cover then this shouldn't be an issue. Also, I contacted the seller requesting a replacement or refund and they were completely uncooperative. I wasted days going back and forth in email with the seller before finally giving up and just submitting a return through Amazon to get my money back. The worse customer service I've yet to experience."
Rose Quartz,"I am one of those people who reads all the reviews and compares countless products even before fairly small purchases, so after all my back and forth I decided on the light pink case from Mosiso because it seemed almost indistinguishable from it competitors and the company had many other Mac products that would hypothetically match if I decided to go that route.My biggest issue is shared blame with me and the seller because little did I know when I bought my ""new to me""  first Mac that the speakers were in the keyboard. That really defeats the purpose of the keyboard cover which was a big selling point of this set for me.I really wish the seller had indicated that issue with the keyboard cover in the description. On top of that the bottom piece of the case is so poorly fitting it only truly grips the sides so the back and front of the bottom are just waiting to be pulled off."
Black,"This comes with a bottom and top plastic hard shell, a keyboard cover and a screen protector. The bottom has protective rubber grips on all corners.  All in all a good value for the price it would seem.The screen protector doesn't completely cover the screen but I did like the keyboard cover. But if all you want is a keyboard cover save money and buy one of those. The shell makes it a good deal heavier than I expected and the added weight from the top shell causes the top too often to flip all the way backwards. I used this for a Macbook Air and it just seems a little too heavy. The added bulk mad it difficult to remove from my carryingsleeve. There is no protection for the hinges if it were to drop so I can't see the benefit. The plastic seems cheap and was marked up with scratches. Also the shell is not easy to remove."
Serenity Blue,"Not fond with the purchase at all.For one, I ordered the light blue however it comes off as a lavender shade.Secondly, either they sent me the wrong size or the cases are overly huge, uncomfortable, and dangerous.In the first picture, I'm showing how much room there is on my case. does not protect, or seem stable at all.In the second image it shows how high the case goes. This is an issue for multiple ways, 1. It overlaps my screen, therefore there could be an issue with scratches on my screen, etc. or 2. When I try to type on my keyboard, the bottom of the case is piercing and scratching into my forearms.Lastly, when I had opened the case straight out of the bag, the corner was already halfway broken off, therefore portraying a cheap product.Cute, but not worth it. Would not purchase again. Highly disappointed."
Marsala Red,"This product is 2/3 of the way there. The bottom piece fits snugly and securely. I usually find keyboard overlays annoying but this one quickly molds to the keys and I really like it. The top piece, however, started popping off after about 5 days of use and eventually (like after another 5 days of resecuring it multiple times a day), one of the four tabs that is supposed to hold it on snapped off, taking a small chunk of the cover with it. I'll be looking for a flexible case to replace at least that part of it. Probably worth spending more to not be left with just a piece of garbage in <2 weeks."
Wine Red,"I purchased the light blue cover. Initially I was very happy with the purchase, however the lighter color stains EXTREMELY easily. I carry my laptop to and from school - I don't tend to take it anywhere out of the ordinary that would stain it. The light blue cover is now covered in smudges. I have tried to use damp wipes to clean the stains and they do not come off. It is to the point that I am kind of embarrassed to take my laptop out in class.Additionally, I purchased my light blue cover on December 18th (It is now February 22, so its been about two months). One of the pads on the bottom cover fell off the other day. I could understand this level of wear and tear after several months, but after only two months - when I carry it around in a padded laptop pocket in my backpack - seems a little ridiculous.All in all, I want my money back, or at least an exchange for a darker color."
Marsala Red,"Keyboard cover and screen protector worked well. Plastic casing, however, cracked easily  - the pieces stayed snapped in place for the most part but did come unhinged randomly when I picked my laptop up - I did make sure to snap it on properly per the instructions but it still came off and it broke where it was supposed to snap on since the plastic is very thin. I use my laptop alot and it gets moved around so I was hoping to find something that could protect the outside somewhat. Attached are pics of where it cracked. It was a pretty color and looked like a really good deal but now I will need to find something a bit more durable."
Serenity Blue,"My other hardcover case was breaking from being in my backpack and recklessly dropping it wherever I pleased. So it was time for a new one! I bought a different brand and was open to trying a new one. This one had really good reviews and 4.5 stars so I figured I'd give it a try.I am very disappointed in the product I received. The top of the case came with black spots over it that wouldn't rub off. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if I didn't get the serenity blue case, which is very light in color, so the black spots are very noticeable. Two of the feet on the bottom also weren't put on straight, so they are half coming off. Will be switching back to the previous brand.Also to be noted, the serenity blue isn't transparent enough to see my decal through the case. Which I was disappointed with, but isn't a physical problem that is the company's fault. And the screen protector isn't a perfect fit with the screen (13 in), there is a few mm of wiggle room, which is an annoying thing for me, because I'm a little anal about these kinds of things. But if there is supposed to be a little room then that's okay."
Camel,"I loved this case when I received it!  The color is beautiful and cleaning and application tools were provided with the case.  When I first placed the case on my laptop, I noticed that the cover for the top of the laptop was slightly more difficult to put on and it first had trouble staying in place.  This didn't bother me because I was initially able to make it stay on after pushing the corner in after it popped out.  And it only popped out once in a while so I didn't really mind this slight inconvenience.  However, only after nearly a month a part (that holds onto your laptop) of the top case fell off.  Literally, it just fell off the case one day - it wasn't even hanging on to the rest of the case, it just fell off.  Sadly, the case was useless after the part fell off and I had to throw the case away.  It's such a pity because I really loved this case.  If only the top cover stayed on, I would have given this product 5 stars. :(("
Camel,"Four stars for the case. But here are the issues:1.Keyboard cover blocks a lot of keyboard backlight. In dark, It's hard to figure out the keys even with backlight in full brightness.2. The screen protector came crumbled in the package - has a fold/crack, that renders it useless.3. It takes 5-6 days for delivery.So basically you are paying for a decent quality cover only."
Black,"Keyboard Cover:- Silicone construction makes typing slow and cumbersome.- The fit is not precise, weird creases around caps lock key.- Does stick to keyboard well, won't fly off if there's a strong wind.Case:- Looks good for first few days.- Matte finish scratches easily.- The 4 rubber grippers on the bottom are great, they add good height to keep the laptop off the ground when setting it down so that the edges don't touch before the rubber grippers."
Rose Gold,"1st review the day I got it: (scroll down for an update)This thing is so cute! I love it. I ordered the rose gold and it is such a pretty color. It snaps right on and stays up there! Doesn't make my computer feel any bulkier or anything. The keyboard cover can be a little sticky but it's so pretty that I can deal with it. It also suppresses the sound a little when you're playing something so beware of that as well. I am awful at putting on screen protectors and messed mine up in the process of putting it on so I can't speak for that, but I have had screen protectors of similar feel on my phone and they held up nicely, and they were on an object where the screen is constantly exposed, so I know this one would have been awesome and would have lasted forever. You can see the Apple pretty clearly as well through the cover, especially with high brightness, which was something I was worried about but it still looks good although a little fuzzy. All in all, love it!!! I'm gonna buy more colors!Update:It broke! I bought this thing April 8th and today, April 26th, I realized it was broken on the sides in the same spot. I have no idea how since I only move it from the counter to the table every so often, but I do it gently so it shouldn't have broke. I'm very sad becuase this case was so pretty but now I am going to return it and try to find something more durable."
Rose Quartz,"I bought this product about a month ago.I wanted to make sure that I use the product for a while before posting a review.I got this product with a blue pen mark on the top when it was delivered. Keyboard cover was a bit thicker than I was expecting but it was okay.After two days or so, I noticed that one of the four white circular antislip sticker was sticking to the case anymore.I've never dropped it but I do think it is a durable case that protects my laptop.Looking at the other reviews, it seems like I just happened to be one of the unlucky people who got a case with a blue pen mark and have a problem with the sticker.I was thinking of buying a clear one after using this one but I am reconsidering that."
Rose Quartz,"I really liked this when I first got it. However, after 5 months it's already broken. And this was after normal use, no dropping. The tabs that hold it onto the computer snapped off and now it won't stay on. I've had other cases that lasted years. Not really worth the money."
Marsala Red,"I purchased this case in late July to protect my work Macbook Air.  It didn't last four months, before it had cracks in it, was not staying on (due to the cracks), and two of the rubber feet had fallen off.  Now I understand why it was so cheap.  Now keep in mind.  This computer is well kept, has never been dropped, tossed about, etc.  It stays on my desk at work, except for rare occasions, when it may need to go home, as I have an iMac and MacBook Pro at home, so thanks to Cloud technology, etc., I can do my work on my home computers.  If you are OCD about blemishes showing on your case, then this case is not for you either.  That did not bother me, but if it bothers you, then the material is not for you."
Marsala Red,Poorly made! The top cover doesn't have the clip things on the side so the top looks like it could come off at any moment. The bottom has clips on the slide but the plastic is so rough that I get scratched every time I attempt to type. And I don't have the strength to return this awful product! I always ordered from a different brand so I don't know how I even bought from the company! I'm very disappointed!
Marsala Red,"I bought this back in January. About four months later, the case began to crack on me. Right now, the case has several broken pieces and cracks in it. I have to super glue a piece back together This is just to the bottom case. The top case is okay. I don't not like the rubber keyboard cover. It does not lay right on the keyboard."
Rose Quartz,"The MacBook cover is alright. But the keyboard cover doesn’t exactly fit/cover the letters, there are shadows. And the screen protector is really NO good, it doesn’t fit the screen well, and I had to re-adjust it many times and it didn’t work, I end up throwing it away. I had to buy a separate screen protector... Frustrated..."
Wine Red,"The Bottom case's back corners did not come up all the way to cover the whole corner. I have another case in a different color and it is very different from the one that I received today. The top doesn't snap on unless you snap it on the top and then slide it down but once I got it on, I can not remove the case no matter how hard I try. I finally got the bottom one off but the top is stuck. Besides all of this, I love the keyboard cover and the screen protector, but I am going to be returning this for a different color and see if it's any different from this one."
Black,"It was nice for a little bit, maybe like two weeks, but the case continuously just falls off my laptop as I am typing. Also, the cover for the keys kept leaving marks on my screen which was making my computer dirtier. If you are looking for short term quality I guess I​ would recommend but if you are looking long term, do not get this."
Black,the bottom of the product will not stay attached to my computer
Rose Quartz,"I bought this case and was looking forward to it for a while. When it arrived, it came in a cheap plastic bag. Nevertheless, I continued on. When I pulled it out, I realized it didn't have the keyboard cover. Still okay, and kept looking. I then found this weird plastic sheet with nothing in it. Lastly, I looked on it and noticed a large crack reaching down the bottom shell. I'll still keep it, but learn that a deal this good has its flaws."
Camel,"At first, I loved it :) the color looked settled , and the case fits my MacBook Air 13 inch perfectly , but after using it for a couple of months it started chipping  which shows that its a poor quality case."
Wine Red,"The case is nice, the screen protector is wonderful, and the keyboard cover is very helpful. However, it is not true to its color. I ordered wine red and got a faded red. Not at all pleased."
Rose Quartz,"the cover is absolute trash, it does not completely fit the laptop so there will be very tiny gaps here and there so it may fall off any time. The microfiber cloth that it provides is dust inducing so the more you use it to clean your screen, the dustier the screen gets."
Rose Gold,"The product, honestly, is not worth 14 dollars. It was cheaply made, and doesn't properly fit my macbook. It looks and feels like someone just spray painted another case. There's a small hair that seems stuck to the case with paint. It's just not well made. Beautiful colour and very nice packaging though."
Capulet Olive,"I've had this case now for a few months and it's already breaking. I bought this case to replace another one that stopped fitting, and now this one is the same way. This case snaps on very nicely when you first purchase it, but within a few weeks, it will get looser and looser. With both cases, I found that the little tabs that hold the case to the computer either wear down or break off completely. It has gotten to the point where the bottom case just falls off when I pick up my computer, and now I need yet another case. I like having a one on my computer, but I can't keep pouring money into these cheap, poorly made cases."
Wine Red,The color is not as rich as the picture and it pops off my laptop extremely easy! I wouldn't recommend this product.
Rose Quartz,Looks great. Came cracked in one corner & bottom shell doesn’t fit properly. Does the trick but certainly lacking in quality. Key board cover muffled speakers. Good look but not functional.
Frost,The edges that secure this case to my computer broke within 2 months. Won't be buying again.
Rose Quartz,"My girlfriend bought me this as a Christmas gift, as my request. And it's only been a month and the top part is already broken. sad because I really like it :("
Marsala Red,"My case came already broken and kept cracking and breaking. It works really well besides that, and the keyboard cover is really nice. I would recommend it if you don't mind buying a new one every couple of months."
Marsala Red,I ordered this case and when it came it was not the color that was advertised online. It came in a much duller maroon/red color. I am very disappointed by this.
Black,It'll do the job I guess. Didn't come with plugs other cases come with. It adds some wait to the screen so it flows around when not on a flat surface
Rose Gold,Keyboard cover does not match up with the keys on your MacBook at all. Sticky pads underneath already fell off:(!! Love the colour tho!
Marsala Red,Doesn't fit quite right and breaks within a week. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!
Marsala Red,I was really excited for my case to arrive but was very disappointed when I opened the package found a crack on the bottom corner of the case.
Clear,Top portion of the case didn't even fit my MacBook Air 13 but the bottom portion did which doesn't even make sense . Going to return .
Marsala Red,The case was ok but it did not snap on completely so idk if it is to safe for my computer
Frost,Finger prints stain on the cover after a couple time. Does not look good.
Marsala Red,top cover has already started coming off..it's been one month and I don't travel with this computer
Airy Blue,Front cover did not fit
