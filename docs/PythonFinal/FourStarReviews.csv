"on January 25, 2018","I've purchased Mosiso cases before, and I only have one complaint.They're so snug on your computer, it's difficult to take off to replace. I've been using the same purple one for years until it got too dirty to maintain any longer. Though the bottom case slid off with ease, the top is sticking to my computer like glue. However, I've managed to remove the case before and I know I can do it again, just with some effort.Other than that, I've had no problems with the protection of my computer. I dropped my computer on my hardwood floor once (from quite high up, too) and my computer suffered no damage using a Mosiso case. The only damage from the fall was a small chip in the side of the case, which barely affected its use. I'm not saying these cases are made to protect from falls, but I'm saying that they are good for their price and they do a good job of protecting from scratches and minor blows. I'd definitely recommend this product to those looking for a light, good-looking case."
"on February 15, 2018","I've had this case on my laptop for almost a year, and it still looks new. It was very easy to ""install"". It doesn't add a lot of bulk, and it's got a nice feel. There are two reasons why I didn't give it 5 starts though. First, the rubber stopper sticker feet don't stay on. I'm pretty sure there were extras, but who knows what I did with them? Anyway it slides around on my cheap laptop fan thingie. So I wrapped a headband around the cooling pad. It helps a little. The second thing is that I've worn holes through several of the keys on the keyboard cover. Plus it won't stay put, keeps wanting to move around. Time to replace it. Other than those kinda petty things, it's been a great purchase. Would buy again, but it looks like I won't have to for quite a while."
"on November 25, 2017","I bought one of these in a different color about a year ago and recently I dropped my MacBook and it broke.  Saved the computer....thank you!  Then I ordered this color.  For some reason it didn't fit as well.  The cover didn't snap on as easily as the one previously purchased and the keyboard cover was almost too big......So, I scheduled a return.  Sigh.  Then I got busy and the return seemed a hassle.  I received a personal email from the company asking what they could do to help me have a better experience, which was really nice and a month later, I am getting around to this review.  I gave 4 stars because of the initial fit, but now, either I am used to how it fits, or it has molded to my laptop and keyboard.  All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with this product.  Long/short, by waiting before I returned it, it seems to have fitted itself."
"on January 23, 2018","Overall I like this case and would probably give it more around a 3.5/5 stars. It looks nice and fits perfectly. The screen protector fits nicely and went on pretty easily; there were only a couple of bubbles that I couldn't get out due to a couple of specks of dust. The keyboard protector takes some getting used to because it is stickier than the regular keyboard, but I live in the dusty, sandy desert and appreciate how well it is protecting my keyboard. For such a lightweight item, it definitely does add a lot of weight to my MacBook Air. It is also pretty uncomfortable where my wrists/lower arms rest on the edge of the laptop. I feel like if I keep this case on, I will need to buy some sort of padding to put over the edges."
"on October 26, 2017","Somewhat jagged edges, as to be expected from such a cheap case, but fits remarkably well! The measurements are perfect and it doesn't move at all. I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard cover and mainly just use it to help prevent dust, bc it's VERY hard to type with. You have to press your fingers down SUPER hard. But overall I'd definitely recommend this, especially for the price! And the Carolina blue color is super beautiful!"
"on February 5, 2018","Highly Recommend! I don't usually write reviews but I just loved this case. I couldn't believe that $14 could get me a computer case, keyboard cover, and a screen protector. The keyboard cover is pretty, but when I have a lot to type up (ex. school), it can get a little bothersome so when I have a lot to do, I just take off the keyboard cover. Other than that, I do keep the cover on. The screen protector has easy installation but I don't know how effective it would be in the case that I drop my laptop. The computer case itself is such a beautiful color (I got the shade ""camel""). I thought that it would be lighter, like how the images showed, but it ended up being darker than expected. However, this color I think is far prettier and it seems as though it can handle stains. After using it for about a week, the case is still pretty clean with no noticeable marks. FYI: I carry my laptop around with me EVERYWHERE. I only didn't give it a full 5 stars because of the keyboard cover. Oh, and if you decide that you want to take the case off, it'll take some effort as it is well on."
"on July 30, 2017","It was delivered in great condition and the Deep Teal color is exactly what it looked like on the website. It came with extra feet for the bottom and everything fits properly. The top feels nice and the Apple logo still glows through it clearly. The keyboard cover is cut well, but unfortunately the letters aren't cut out so you can't really get the most out of your backlit keyboard. It took me a little bit to get used to typing with it and it sometimes sticks a little, but I think that will go away with time (and more practice). I didn't put the screen protector on it, so can't really give you any help with that. Overall, very happy with my purchase!"
"on September 26, 2017","It has a really nice and simple aesthetic to it, and is serving it's purpose nicely. I do not expect it to protect the laptop fully if it were to go down with the case on it, after all, it is only hard plastic and not really designed to protect from drop damage. However, it works well in the sense that it is protecting the outer layers of my laptop, including the screen & keyboard, which were nice additions.The only reason I have one star taken off is because the bottom piece of the case, with the base, does not seem to fit properly and fully on the laptop itself. The right side of the case towards the track pad area simply will not click and go down all the way, leaving a slightly raised lip and unhatched corner of the case. I do not think it is me doing it wrong, because I have tried multiple times to put it on correctly, and it just won't go."
"on January 3, 2018","Everything fit nicely. The keyboard cover has a nice color and it also doesn't smear and get on my fingers like my previous keyboard cover did. The quality of the case itself is appropriate for the price, which is more than enough for me as long as it provides protection. I like how the case itself is see through so that the beauty of my decals is visible but if you are not careful, the plastic of the case can break or crack easily. Only problem I had was the screen protector, which is nearly impossible to apply without getting dust or air bubbles on it; it bothered me so much that I discarded it after using it for less than a day. Don't bother with the screen protector and just buy the hard case and keyboard cover combo."
"on February 10, 2017","Had issues with speck case fitting properly, it was so overstretched it would crack in a day, last speck case lasted 3 years, so decided to try Mosiso case for my kid's air due to the good reviews.The Mosiso works well, fit on without a lot of fuss once I figured out the top orientation (so it is not undersized like speck's case).Quality though is slightly off, with some plastic flashing (excess plastic during mold process) not properly trimmed in a few spots (easily fixed with a utility knife, exacto knife, or razor, but you shouldn't have to do this.Overall fit is good, though the top cover front snaps don't always stay in position, but do hold in place.I will say that there is a lack of info on how to install this, the bottom is pretty intuitive, but the top isn't.  And the photo provided as part of the item description doesn't help with which is the front or back of the top cover."
"on January 1, 2018","good product, I like the build, materials, design & texture. The only weakness is that the sticky feet slip off eventually (maybe due to the heat of the laptop). The co. must be aware of this, as this would explain why they give extra feet! I've only been using it for roughly a month and the 2 rear feet started moving/slipping 2 weeks ago. Today one finally came off! :("
"on December 10, 2017","The case is terrific and wonderfully protective for my computer, as well as looking quite stylish. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs fault the delivery snafu was, I just know the order was inexplicably delayed by several days, and according to the Amazon operator,  it never arrived. It did, but my account still does not indicate that. So only four stars."
"on November 16, 2017",Pros :1) super easy to put on2) the screen protector doesnt even look like it's on now (at first i was scared it'd look ugly3) love how the bottom case has cushions and backup cushions!Cons :1) the top case will have plastice wrapped around it do not use anything sharp or dull or whatever to open it . Use your nails . I used my car keys to cut open the plastic wrap and it ended up scratching the top case . Regrets about that üòÇ2) the keyboard cover feels ugly i'd rather type on the actual keyboard i just dont like it . It feels ugly honestly like i just threw cheap rubber on top . And the keyboard cover is foggy it's not clear .But overall it's an alright product . I mean im not complaining that much üòÇüëèüèª
"on August 27, 2017","'Clicks-in-place' --- fits well like your custom-made hand gloves. It would have been much nicer (I thought) it comes in ""glossy wine red""; it's more like a 'flat or dull maroon'; the keyboard protective cover, indeed is a complete protection! I will buy other colors later. Delivery?--- FREE in under 48 hours, faster than a 747 jet! Thanks folks."
"on September 26, 2017","Love this case! It snapped on quickly and very easily and doesn't budge once its on unless you pick at it. The texture is so smooth, almost suede-like. I wasn't a fan of the keyboard cover though which is the only reason that I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5. It was just too thick so it made typing feel kinda weird and I made a lot of typos with it on. I personally like the clickiness of the keyboard so the soft rubber cover just wasn't for me. I'm sure it would have been fine with some getting used to though. I also haven't used the screen protector that came with it. I don't really see the point in it since it's a laptop and you close it when you're not using it... kinda protects itself."
"on November 6, 2017","RE: PLASTIC HARD CASE,  IT'S FINE. NOTHING PARTICULARLY SPECIAL BUT IT COVERS THE LAPTOP AS PICTURED AND PROTECTS AGAINST SCRATCHES. SOMETIMES THE EDGE CAN SLIP OFF THE CORNER  IF YOU DON'T PRESS IT ON  SECURELY. THE KEYBOARD COVER IS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. IT PROTECTS THE KEYBOARD FROM DUST AND CRUMBS AND LETTERS ARE EASILY VISIBLE. ALSO, I RECEIVED IT SOONER THAN EXPECTED. THAT WAS NICE."
"on November 2, 2017",Looks just as it does in pic... it would be helpful if they included very simple instructions. Even my p1 licensed plumber boyfriend had to mess with it about 60 secs. Other than that I don‚Äôt use the keyboard protector bc you can‚Äôt truly type documents on it. The case is very very nice. It‚Äôs got a great solid feel to it. Very impressed especially for the low price tag.
"on September 7, 2017",Surprisingly this thing works pretty great. It snapped in place fairly simple. The key pad protector falls right on top of the keys with nothing sticky nonsense. The only thing that doesn't work well is the screen protector. You can't press hard on the screen to get the bubbles out. But other than that the case works great.
"on April 21, 2017","I was excited to receive this case and found that it fits my computer well. Unfortunately, the rubber dots that are supposed to be glued into the holes on the bottom of the cover were not in the holes correctly. Two of them even sit slanted in the holes. The case still sits fairly straight. The dots just make the computer off balance, and it is annoying to deal with. The package did come with an extra set of grip dots, but I did not want to completely waste a set of rubber grips, just in case they fall off later. Other than that, I have had this product for almost a month and it seems to work fine. I would purchase this product again because the grip issue doesn't prevent the case from protecting my computer, which is the reason I purchased the product in the first place."
"on December 29, 2017","The covers fit well on the top and bottom and I always like a keyboard cover for my keys. I was a bit worried that the color on the keyboard cover would come off but it's been a few months and so far so good! The only issue is since it's a darker color and the letters aren't clear, the keyboard illumination doesn't really show up - not a big deal for me but maybe for others. The top and bottom cover feel nice to the touch and I love the color but the softer material coating tends to hold fingerprints/smudges. The clips that snap on the edges of the computer are not flush/raised a bit more than I'd like but not terrible. Not using the screen protector but looks like it would fit. All in all, feels sturdy enough to protect from scratches/general wear and tear, nice color, and great for the price!"
"on May 6, 2017","The color was lovely (though a bit more saturated than it appears in this photo). I had to return it because the one I got didn't fit snugly onto my laptop--the bottom notch wasn't quite right and it kept slipping off. I probably just got one that was a little off, though, and I'm sure most of them fit just fine."
"on December 12, 2017",I  really don't know what to say.  Just received it three days ago. Haven't used the product yet.  It's part of a Christmas present for my kid. She will be the true test of its quality. I was asked to review it so I did the best with what I know so far.  I will try to update after Christmas when she gets a chance to use it.
"on December 11, 2016","I love this stylish product!  Very simple to attach to keep my (3rd) Mac as scratch free as possible.  I'm not giving the full 5 star rating only because the keyboard is more difficult for me to type quickly on than the naked keys.  But that is just my experience. I do use the key cover, however, every time I put my computer away as a protective cover.  I would definitely buy this product again, and just might in different colors for the fun of it! :)Received the product in record time - very pleased with the seller."
"on February 6, 2017","Just got this in the mail, first things first, I thought it would be destroyed (not manufacturers fault) but because it arrived in a box that was not in the best condition. Luckily it held up! Color is not as bubblegum pink as it looks in pic, more of a dark rosegold-ish pink, still cute. The keyboard cover fits perfectly and I have no problem typing with it, sticks really well! Won't be using the giant screen protector but definitely a great price for all of these items you get! I honestly gave it 4/5 stars because it was pretty hard to put on my MacBook Air without feeling like I was gonna crush the entire MacBook. Took me a little while and I'm not really sure if it's on correctly currently."
"on February 20, 2017","Edit on 2/24/17:I have now recieved the replacement for this product with all the components in there original packaging and they are highly satisfactory.  The cover that i had originally recieved had not been inside a package and were all loose and bundled into a label-less bag.  If yours came in that way and or it keeps falling off i recommend you contact Amazon Customer service to rectify the situation.  The one i had would fall all the time but the replacement snapped right into place.and has smooth edges, not the sharp ones of the other case.Original Post: (1 star)I did not receive a keyboard cover with my purchase. Seeing as the main reason I bought this bundle was for all the components it came with to protect my computer I find this purchase unsatisfactory."
"on January 25, 2017","This is a great case for the price! The color options for these laptops cases are really nice and you cannot beat how affordable they are. Apple would charge at least 3x this amount!Although the case is just a thin piece of plastic it does the job. It isn't the highest quality, but you get what you pay for! The case simply has edges that clip over the edge of you laptop to stay on. I bought this to put stickers on so I wouldn't be putting them directly on my laptop, and it works perfectly.If you are looking for an affordable laptop cover to make it look more aesthetically pleasing then look no further. This is not meant to be a durable case to save your laptop from damage other than protecting from minor scratches and dents."
"on February 23, 2017","This case is very beautiful and fits my computer perfectly! The only downfall was the screen protector was a tad too small, left about a cm of screen showing on one side, and the keyboard cover doesn't match up perfectly with the print on the keys. I took the screen protector off and trashed it, but the keyboard doesn't bother me really. I prefer it over the slick keys."
"on March 6, 2017","I absolutely love the look of this case! I plan on buying one for my fianc√©'s MacBook soon. The only thing that is a little bothersome is that the part that clips on by the track pad comes uncliped every once in a while. It's no big deal, I might take it off and put it back on to see if that helps it stay better. I think the main reason it does that is bc that is where I rest my arm on it so it gets more resistance."
"on June 4, 2017","I love the cover! The color is gorgeous and it was very easy to put on.  I haven't had it very long and haven't taken it outside of my home, so I cannot comment on its durability. The keyboard cover is nice, but the numbers/words don't exactly match up with the keys. This to me isn't a big deal because I didn't care that much about a keyboard cover and unless I'm staring and analyzing it, it's not really noticeable."
"on August 10, 2017","I used this as my laptop case for my entire first year at college, and it held up incredible well for the amount it was used/banged around, with no additional damage to my laptop. It is true to color, and even has an almost matte finish that allows stickers to stick to it without peeling up at the edges (if this is of concern to you). It is not very opaque, so you can see that there is a light but you cannot make out the apple logo. After using it for exactly a year, I finally broke off a small section of the bottom protector where the USB ports are. The plastic is a little thinner here, and it may have been a result of dropping it. It is still usable though! But for the price this product is absolutely worth it!"
"on January 17, 2017","The hard case fits very well on my MacBook air. I love the color, though it does resemble more of a baby pink rather than a rose gold. I love the look of it, that you can still see the apple lit up through the top of the case, and the air vents on the bottom to keep it from being over heated. Only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 star is the keyboard cover. It fits very well over the keys, but the print doesn't quite match up with the keys underneath. Not a huge problem in well lit areas, but if the keys light up, it shines through the cover and can be difficult to read both print on top of each other."
"on December 18, 2016","I purchased this MacBook Air Hard Case for my recently purchased MacBook Air. I must admit that this is the first time I buy a case for my computer and I am surprised at the quality of the material and the color (black) of the case, as it matches my MacBook Air very well. The case in general is smooth to the touch and the key board cover is soft on the keys (which I like). I use my computer a lot, and now with this case it feels more sturdy and safe from scratches and I would even say even some drops. The only reason why I did not give the product five stars is due one side of the case (bottom keyboard side) not clipping on all the way, which could just be a defect on the case I got."
"on August 10, 2017","I'm loving my new laptop case and keyboard cover! The color is absolutely stunning (I love the matte look of it), but I am concerned that it will become dirty easily, so keep that in mind when you choose your color. I'm thinking about purchasing a second case in navy blue so that I can avoid the discoloration. I'm loving the case's texture - it is significantly softer than I ever expected. I'm not a fan of plastic that looks ""junky,"" so I was pleasantly surprised when I unboxed my purchase.I purchased some stickers to put on the case as well, and I can't wait to see how it looks. This case is definitely a steal! I highly recommend."
"on October 4, 2017","Fits my 2010 13"" macbook air perfectly.My only complain is that the icons on the keyboard cover are mixed up in a few places. The volume up button icon is where the volume down button actually is. It is a little confusing when I'm trying to change the volume.Note that this rose gold is more of a cool-toned rose gold, so it doesn't perfectly match other rose gold colors such as the rose gold iphone or the rose gold Beats headphones. However, the difference is very slight and not noticeable at a glance.Overall I am happy with my purchase!"
"on January 11, 2017",Seems to be a great case. Sturdy and handsome without a rubberized layer that flakes off (as I've seen on some printed cases). I ditched the keyboard cover since it distorts and muffles the computer's speakers.Update: One of the clips holding this onto my computer has broken. The case has served me nobly for 3 months but unfortunately it's probably not going to last much longer
"on April 15, 2017","My only major complaints are with the keyboard cover. I got the set in Rose Quartz (a light/baby pink). I really love the color but it's hard to see the white letters on the keyboard cover. This problem is actually even worse if you turn on the keyboard backlight. Also the keyboard cover is a bit loose on the keys on the very left edge - it doesn't seem to be sitting flat. Hoping this part at least improves over time. The laptop case was a bit difficult to snap on at first, and screen protectors are always a PITA, but there was nothing significantly problematic about the laptop case or screen protector."
"on October 24, 2017","Looks just like it does in the picture. Very light and not very noticeable if you got the grey cover, that matches the same as MacBooks.Only qualm is the keyboard skin it came with does not let the backlight of the keys to show thru, so in my opinion it would be only useful to keep dust out and not very useful at night or in dark rooms."
"on October 25, 2017","Excellent case. Exactly what I wanted. Colors looks good, fits description. Fits my MacBook Air perfectly and is still thin enough to fit into a sleeve.Would give it 5 stars if the screen protector was a bit nicer and because I accidentally dropped my laptop from a waist height onto carpet today and the plastic case cracked. The bottom piece is now unusable :( Really upsetting because I loved this product! While it's my fault for dropping the item, I was hoping the case would be a little bit more durable to withstand a short fall onto a slightly cushioned surface. BUT it did protect my laptop, which is what it's there for"
"on February 2, 2018","Received my case in tightly wrapped plastic. After I installed both pieces on to my air, I noticed there was a small crack on the side of the bottom piece. This is my first apple laptop, when I purchased it at Best Buy the sales person told me not buy a snap on case because a previous customer did and it cracked the screen. Although, the top price doesn‚Äôt quite snap on it manages to stay in place. The one item that really like is the keyboard cover it fits over the keyboard perfectly. The screen protector is cool. I‚Äôve only had the cover for a few days. I think it‚Äôs cool for price."
"on October 1, 2017","I have the macbook air a1466 and it fits very well. I got the clear and it is very clear, and well madee. The keyboard cover was kind of thin but it does the job. I haven't tried the screen protector yet, but it seems to be well made"
"on August 29, 2017",I don't typically write reviews but I have to say I'm satisfied with my purchase for this. At first I was a bit hesitant as I read the some of the critical comments which made me not want to get it. Ignoring those comments I took a risk and bought it hoping for the best and I'm extremely happy with how it turned out. The only thing I didn't really like is the keyboard cover but other then that everything is perfect. The case fits perfectly and snapped into place with very little effort. I definitely would recommend it if you are looking to purchase a Mac cover.
"on July 21, 2017","So far I like it. I wish the case had a cut out for the logo but even then it still looks pretty nice. The rose gold isn't too much of a rose gold though, it's more like a glittery pinkish color. The screen protector that came with it collected a lot of dust etc & wasn't the exact fitting of the screen so I took it off but it doesn't matter, to me the protector was just a bonus.Overall it's nice I just wish the color was true rose gold."
"on January 1, 2018","The case is well made, has a nice feel to it and was easy to snap on. Only compliant was that I thought it would be more transparent than it is. I ordered the green and when looking online, it seemed to show the apple light, however, in person you cannot. The keyboard protector works well, but I found I have a hard time typing on it and was too lazy to retrain my finders to get used to it, so I took it off. I didn't want to use the screen protector, so I cannot comment on that. Over all it is a really good product for the price."
"on March 14, 2017","Fits the case perfectly; much easier than a brand that cost 3x as much as eventually broke. Love the color options, too. Only complaint would be that it shows dirt (e.g., oils from fingers) easily. But perhaps that is my fault for going with a light color.  Also, do not buy for the screen protector.  I threw mine away.  It is VERY reflective and I think it would've obscured by picture on my screen."
"on November 19, 2017",Just got this. Its super super thin plastic from other reviews i feel like this wont protect anything from a drop. its a very nice color though. i have the marsala red. worth for just decoration wouldnt use it for anything else. keyboard protector is super thin but looks like itll do its job. you get what you pay for here.
"on May 13, 2017","Loved everything about it, from the feel to the fit, but especially the color. But after a while it started getting so dirty, absorbing colors from the surfaces I set it on and the bags I carried it in. Currently searching for a different case :( But! Looking at the make of the case bc I was v impressed with everything else."
"on July 16, 2017","The screen protector did not work out well for me, but everything else does. The color is very nice, and it has a nice smooth cover. The only problem is it comes with no instructions, and the bottom half is always trying to click off. I just put it back on and keep a trucking. Overall I am very pleased and I think they have done a great job."
"on December 14, 2017","The screen protector and keyboard slip are both wonderful, and the actual hard case fits well. It pops off sometimes if I put a little pressure on the edges, but otherwise it stays put. The top smudges easily, which gets on my nerves a little (neat freak, haha) but I ordered the black one so the smudges might not turn up as much on other colors. If you‚Äôre looking for a cheap cover for your laptop, this one works. Definitely not entirely top of the line, but it works for me and I have no major complaints."
"on January 31, 2018",I would have given this 5 stars but bc I got such a light color (super light pink) any time anything touches the case it leaves a mark or a print. However it does its job and you guys the keyboard cover fits perfectly. I had a different color/brand case on w the keyboard cover and I hated it the keys would always stick but the keyboard cover that comes w this is srsly so amazing it feels like the actual keys. You have to buy this if u need a macbook case.
"on October 3, 2017","I love the case and the keyboard cover as well as the screen protector. The feeling of the case is very nice and the keyboard cover too. Unfortunately when I received this in the mail, there was a small scratch on the cover and marks but very little. I also feel that it makes the audio of my mac air sound a bit weird.. almost muffled. But not too severely. Other than that, very great :)"
"on January 20, 2017","The case snapped onto my laptop without any issues, and the keyboard cover fit the keys perfectly. The case part for the top half of the laptop fit better than the bottom, I feel like it is a teensy bit loose on the bottom corners by the trackpad. It won't make any difference but I'd feel better if there was no movement. I don't think this case would be very helpful in protecting against drops, but I feel pretty good about it helping me avoid scratches and very small spills. I bought the product in Marsala Red, and the color is just as it's shown in the product pictures. Overall it seems like it's going to be a great case."
"on May 26, 2017","Camel color is not what I expected. It's more of a tan flat/matte color, it's darker than the photo. There was also a minor scratch on the top part of the case, but it's not large enough to bother me. The only reason why I'm keeping this is because the keyboard cover is really nice, it's easy to type with and feels comfortable. Quality is good overall, just a little disappointed in the color."
"on December 17, 2017","Arrived cracked. However, emailed the company and they sent out a replacement case. Enjoying the new case, but would completly passing on the screen protector. So overall case looks nice."
"on January 8, 2018","I actually like this case. It looks very nice, however, I have had this case for a week or so and when you open the computer, the top part of the case and the bottom tend to rub creating some wear on the edges. Otherwise, it would have been a 5 star rating."
"on January 1, 2018","Purchased for my adult daughter who is very happy with the case.  It does not add significantly to the weight and size of her Macbook Air, but will protect it from damage.  There are vents in the bottom of the case for cooling and white feet. The color is rich and deep, very like the image.  She has not used a keyboard cover before, but is trying this one and seems happy with it at present. The set includes a screen protector and cleaning cloth."
"on July 26, 2017","Love the case. Protects my MacBook and looks cute. Not too crazy about the keyboard overlay or the screen shield. I stopped using the overlay because it slid around a bit & bugged me although it looked cute. The screen protector is nice because it prevents scratches, but it attracts every speck of dust on the planet! I never have a clean screen anymore and it drives me bananas. I'm constantly wiping it down."
"on January 2, 2018","Was expecting the rubberized coating. this works, just not as expected. the keyboard backlight won't shine through the keyboard cover so you can't see the keys in the dark."
"on March 3, 2017","A little bit loose on the bottom case, but stays on with no problem. Occasionally, I have to snap the bottom back on after my laptop's been closed and carried in my bag for a little while. Also, the keyboard cover is just slightly misaligned with the actual letters printed on my keys--creates a ""ghost"" effect when I turned my backlight on. I solved this problem by keeping my backlight off. A small price to pay for a clean keyboard, though, and it's not an inconvenience. Great product for the price, exactly the color I love, and overall fits very well!"
"on June 16, 2017",I love the laptop cover. It's the perfect color and was easy to put on. I do not like the keyboard cover however. It makes it really hard to type and I can't see the letters and number on the keyboard at all.
"on December 27, 2016",The aqua color is great! You can see the apple icon lit up through it. So much value! My only con is that the bottom is very slippery so I'm buying non skid tape so I can rest it on my lap and it won't slip off.
"on February 7, 2018","Love the protective cover! The keyboard cover looks really cool, but I just can't type as well with it on so I eventually took it off. I messed up the screen protector in like 2 seconds when trying to put it on (which I kind of knew would happen because it's pretty much impossible to put those things on without air bubbles or hair or whatever). Overall, the case is what matters and it fits just right. Also, the camel color is more like a dusty rose color and I just love it."
"on December 30, 2017",Case is nice and fits my 13‚Äù MacBook Air well.  The keypad cover is not as nice as some I have ordered in the past. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase at this time.
"on March 16, 2017","The case is so beautiful, the screen protector is good. I give four stars because of the keyboard was a little smaller and the letters didn't match very well."
"on November 18, 2016",I got my case super fast.  Only problem is that it's cracked on the side! I hope I can get a new one if I return this one . Other than that the bottom was easy to put on but the top I'm having trouble attaching.
"on February 5, 2018","The apple doesn't show up that well through the red cover, and the letters don't line up exactly with the lit up letters on my keyboard so they look slightly holographic when the lights are on from my keyboard. good product for the price though"
"on October 3, 2017","The case fit snugly and well. The screen protector did not cover the whole screen of my mid-2017 13"" MacBook Air so I didn't install it at all. The keyboard cover (I ordered grey) fits almost perfect, however the bottom right side is slightly raised. I barely notice but worth pointing out. The worse part of the grey keyboard cover is it doesn't allow enough of the backlight thru to be useful. I didn't use the screen protector and will be swapping the keyboard cover for a clear one so the only useful part is the case."
"on October 29, 2017","Love the color of the case. I got the camel, and it came out essentially the same as the picture - a nude color, almost like a muted blush pink. The soft touch is nice also. The keyboard cover is not my favorite because it doesn't fit tightly over the keys, but I still use and like it. The only fault I have with the case is that the bottom cover on the right side doesn't fully snap over my laptop, so the case can be pulled down at that corner, and when I rest my wrist there as I type, it can scratch."
"on October 31, 2017","Great color, feels soft and smooth, it's a great way to protect my new computer. Only downfall is the rubber feet fall off too easy, the sticky glue doesn't stay sticky."
"on November 15, 2017","This case is thin, pretty, and simple. It doesn't let the apple logo shine very clearly, which I would have preferred, but you can see it's there. The screen protector is nice as well, but the keyboard cover had to go. The letters on the cover did not match up with the keyboard's and made it look blurry. I believe there was a similar review to this as well. I gave the cover away but appreciate the other two pieces"
"on March 26, 2017","I ordered this case in clear/transparent. As much as I love pink and other colors, I wanted my beautiful new MacBook Air to speak for itself, while still having strong protection. I found the keyboard protector to be too precarious to use, and don't like the screen protector...but the snap-on case looks nice and seems like it will provide decent protection to my MacBook."
"on May 3, 2017","This case sucks, keeps popping off my computer...what's the pointRetract my statement, I had not popped the case on all the way. You have to hear the click! Works great. Does get dirty easily though."
"on October 11, 2017",Overall good product. Didn‚Äôt give it five stars because it didn‚Äôt WOW me just because it was plain maroon.  It‚Äôs just a laptop hard shell. I use my laptop daily and I‚Äôve had it for a couple months now and it‚Äôs still in great condition! Definitely recommend. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about it was the keyboard cover. Seemed a little cheap.
"on June 14, 2017","Its not quite as sturdy as I thougth it would be. It is a bit translucent to where you can see the apple logo back lit. It does show some signs of wear already but I carry it back and forth to work daily. Overall, I would shop again with them but perhaps a different color."
"on March 18, 2017","I got this shell as extra protection from bending or flexing my Mac air especially when traveling.It was very easy to assemble tne the shell and key board cover work great. The shell is slightly rubberized so it keeps it from being slippery.  The screen protector was very difficult to get on and get out all the bubbles. I ended up leaving it off.My daughter liked mine so much, we orderd her one as well."
"on December 3, 2017","I absolutely love the fit of this case on my Mac. The color is a bit duller than I expected, which is why I docked a star. But, the product is sturdy, and the keyboard pad is super nice!"
"on January 10, 2018","I really love the color, I got the navy blue, and it was exactly what I was expecting. Only complaints would be that any fingerprints are pretty visible on the front, and the light of the computer keys don't shine through the keyboard cover. I have gotten used to those by now, and the fingerprints come off with a washcloth and some water. I have only had it for a few weeks. I recommend!"
"on February 3, 2017","The case was very nice and has an appealing ""soft"" coating on it. It snaps on my Macbook air easily and snugly fits the frame. There's no fear of it inadvertently falling off. My issue is with the keyboard cover. The keyboard cover fits well, but it's opaque. Because the keyboard cover is practically opaque the back light doesn't help and the letters are very difficult to read.I would give the case an ""A"" but the keyboard cover a ""C""."
"on November 17, 2017","Case snaps on super easily, fits great, seems sturdy. The only thing I didn't love is that I ordered the gold color and it's really more of a bronze (my boyfriend literally asked if I ordered a bronze on purpose). Also, the pads on the bottom of the case get worn down super quickly."
"on December 6, 2016","I received my case in the mail a few weeks ago. I like it for the most part. The case seems to be a bit large, and I know I ordered the correct size. It also covers the headphone jack the slightest bit--but its still usable, just a bit alarming. I'd probably order from them again because its a pretty case."
"on September 12, 2016","I bought this going as soon as i purchased my mac because , as a college student , I'm bound to have some accidents.The case was really easy to assemble , has a sort of rubbery plastic feel that I really like.The keyboard thing is also super nice and does not inhibit my typing in any way.Overall look is also super pretty , I got it in the light pink and it is so cute !!The only issue i have is that its very hard to take off. Also , one corner of the case near the keypad keep popping out. But only that corner. Overall not a big deal because the rest of the case has no issues.8/10 recommend !"
"on October 24, 2016","I was a bit hesitant to buy this because of the inexpensive price, I thought it might look cheap. I was pleasantly surprised! It's a light pink, soft, matt case just as pictured.  It fit my lap top perfectly and I really like it! The key board cover is nice as well.  The only downside is the screen protector, I couldn't get it to go on the screen without air bubbles, and the plastic thing they give you to smooth out the bubbles created scratches on the screen protector."
"on January 8, 2018","Case snaps on great so we will see how long it can last. The keyboard cover takes some getting used to but I enjoy it. The screen protector is a nice touch but it doesn't cover the entire screen with a small gap if you apply it all the way to one side, no big deal though!"
"on September 19, 2017","The case is soft, smooth and cute! I got matte white. What was disappointing however is the top case came dirty! Had a few smudges like someone handled it with dirty hands :(If you get a darker color I would recommend, if you get white or a lighter color‚Äã caution because seems like a common theme the case arriving slightly spotty. So sad...The case itself is very nice, received the package 2 days after purchase. Love my case even tho there's a spot."
"on April 23, 2017","It's a beautiful case. A very calm color. The only cons of this product was the cover was a little dirty, the keyboard cover had some little holes, and the keyboard cover is a little loose. The pros are that it is very pretty and the case snaps on well."
"on September 19, 2017","Been on MacBook Air 13 for about a week. I like it. Will keep the case from getting dinged, scratched up. The case is translucent..pretty cool."
"on October 17, 2017","Really great case, I like that theres a certain selection of colors to choose from. I didn't know that it comes with a keyboard protector and a screen protector!! That caught me off guard, although the screen protector is kinda ""cheap"" it still does the work. Will recommend to anyone looking for a one color protector for their personal MacBook!"
"on September 20, 2017","The case is super cute! Absolutely love the color. The case is hard to put on but after much struggle I got it on and I love it! The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the keypad cover letters do not match up with the letter in the actual keyboard. Therefore the actual letters shine through the cover. That might be a little OCD for some but just something I noticed! Other than that, it is a really great product, especially for the price!!"
"on March 18, 2017","This is an adequate case. Definitely not as nice as the Speck cases I've purchased for my kid's laptops, but for the price it's decent. Not as tight fitting as the Speck cases, I feel like if you were carrying your laptop around in a bag or backpack this might not stay on very well. Since I'm just using my laptop at home it will likely be fine."
"on February 13, 2018","I love this case!! It‚Äôs very elegant and sophisticated. However, it gets scratched up VERY easily. I barely touched it and it has scratch marks all over the place. But for the price, I can‚Äôt complain. It protects my laptop and that‚Äôs what matters!"
"on October 16, 2017","Very slim and easy to assemble. However, fingerprint marks are easily left on the case. The casing material picks up the natural oil residue from fingers when picking up/using laptop."
"on May 18, 2017","Love the color of this case, and it performs as expected. However, if you don't like fingerprints and greasy looking smudges, this is not the one for you."
"on December 25, 2016","Overall the product is very good if you can get past the fact that the keyboard cover is a bit off causing the keys to look blurry. My fianc√© is a computer girl so she knows the keys so it generally bothers me more than her. As far as the color (rose gold) pretty much on par with her phone, beats, and Apple Watch that are all matching rose gold. Case fit snugly and the screen protector is a nice touch. Overall, for the price can't really complain."
"on July 26, 2017",The case fits my MacBook Air nicely. I love that I can still see the decals underneath as I'd hoped.
"on January 16, 2018","What I liked the most was first; It arrived early than expected. Second; the smoothness of the product as well as the quality, and third; it was very easy to put on the laptop. What I least disliked about the product, will have to be the screen protector, since it does not cover the full screen.. other than that I am very satisfied with the purchase and I will recommend this product, and will purchase again."
"on January 21, 2018","To be quite honest, I love the color and the quality of the case itself, but I suggest not touching it if your hands are oily in any way. (Mines are since I touch my hair a lot.) Also when I got the package the keyboard cover had a defect on one of the keys. I don't know if it was just mine that came that way, but it's not too nticibale unless I'm looking for it. Overall though, I'm quite satisfied with the product."
"on January 14, 2018","I got periwinkle blue and I am very pleased with this case. My flaws with are the keyboard makes it a little harder to type because I guess I am a light typer, but I'll probably get used to it. The case snapped on well but a couple parts of it are not completely snapped on. Otherwise, it's a well designed case and I would recommend getting it."
"on August 5, 2017","The case fits on snug and it was simple to snap on. I love the keyboard cover as it is not too thick; my last one from a different company was a bit thick and hard to get use to. My only complaint is the screen protector I got had a small imperfection (a dent) on it that when I put it on my screen, a bubble formed around it and won't go away on my screen. I tried to move the air bubble out, but it just won't move."
"on January 14, 2018",Great quality. Fits perfectly. The only problem is the screen protector didn‚Äôt like the quality of that.
"on December 11, 2016","I am definitely happy with the case for the price I paid. It came with a slight scratch on the inside that shows up when on the laptop, but i'm not one to worry about that. it also pops off a little bit and I frequently need to snap one side back on, but it never comes fully off so im not worried about the safety of my laptop because of it. It was very reasonably priced so I am overall happy with my purchase"
"on January 10, 2017","The cases is almost exactly as shown. However, when I received my keyboard cover the letter and numbers did not match the actual letters and numbers on the keys. The color is just like the picture. I am slightly disappointed with the keyboard, but very impressed with the case."
"on May 7, 2017",The Case itself fit like a glove. Love the color (Airy Blue). The case sometime comes off from time to time. But overall great case and keyboard cover. However the screen protector is awful!! It creates to many air bubbles. Tried using a credit card didn't work. Just AWFUL!! And the plastic of the protector is very sticky. A lot of dust and dirty got on the protector. Overall I would give it 5 out of 5 stars. But the screen protector is awful!! Highly don't recommend!!!!
"on February 15, 2018","My only complaint about the case is that after a while it becomes very susceptible to breaking. Also, the white sticker things on the bottom fall out very easily. However, you can't expect anything better with this price."
"on November 26, 2017",Product met my expectations. Just like the picture. I will order again for a different color.
"on November 17, 2017",This cover snaps into place easily and so far no real complaints. The only thing I'd mention is that the keyboard cover mutes the music coming out of the laptop a little bit. Still a bargain at this price and worth it to keep my keyboard free of cat fur :)
"on October 19, 2017","Purchased for daughter's college laptop.  Sent off to UCSD's Amazon pick-up.  I've heard no complaints, so it must be good.  If it was not satisfactory, I would have heard about it."
"on February 5, 2018","Perfect for what I was looking for. Nice case that fits well. Not sure it will survive a hard drop, but will definitely help with scrapes and smears to the outer shell of the computer, and it looks nice. My only issue is that the keyboard cover blocks the illuminated letters, but I didn't necessarily make this purchase for the cover, so I just won't use it. Problem solved.  All around, a good case."
"on January 16, 2018","It looks great and gives me peace of mind and assurance that I won‚Äôt scratch my MacBook on accident. It‚Äôs a little hard to remove, but that‚Äôs fine. The keyboard cover is nice but it makes the keys feels sticky and I find myself missing keys when typing."
"on September 7, 2017",Decent quality case for the price and decent quality keyboard cover but the film had no instruction and I messed it up so that can be better. Also Keyboard cover kinda made typing harder so I guess some people might find it uncomfortable.
"on August 4, 2017","Great case. Easy to install, My daughter loved it. the keyboard cover doesn't fit as well as it should it makes the keys harder to press so she doesn't use it otherwise great case for the price."
"on April 10, 2017",Adorable the the smoky gray color. Looks almost blue black. Very chic. Fingerprints get on it easy. Bottom snaps off occasionally. But cute otherwise.
"on February 7, 2018","really nice, keeps my MacBook Air protected. looks nice and neat. only thing is its almost impossible to remove the top cover if you want to change colors. had to look at you-tube to get advice on how to remove it without damaging the computer. otherwise its a good quality."
"on January 14, 2018","Good product--Doesn,t seem to be as good as some I have purchased in the past, but still good."
"on January 12, 2017","I really love the color and feel of this case. It isn't clunky at all, but it's sturdy enough that I feel like it's protecting my laptop enough. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel like when I open the laptop, the case peels away a bit instead of staying on completely and tightly. Also, I can't get the keyboard cover to lay just right. It always seems to be a bit off and it can throw you off when typing. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase!"
"on March 23, 2017","Case is great, screen protector sucks and so does the keyboard guard."
"on December 16, 2017","Not quite as dark as the photo shows, but I like it. Note: there are 2-3 types of Macbook Airs, so the case may not fit. (I learned this the hard way). Look on the bottom of your macbook, and in tiny font, it'll say the model."
"on November 15, 2016","I got the Rose Gold case, and I was actually impressed with the color. The case fits well on the MacBook, but it is slightly loose on the bottom part of the laptop. I haven't been able to put the screen protector on my laptop just yet since there were no instructions in the box on how to do so. I'm sure there are instructions online for the screen protector. You pretty much get what you paid for with the case"
"on August 20, 2017","I absolutely love my new case and the color is so perfect. It came early in the mail but my only complaint is that there is a chip in the bottom half of the case, it's not super noticeable but I was bummed when I saw it. And the keyboard cover looked a bit damaged/used in a way.. but overall I still love it and will use it. I'm tempted to buy more colors!"
"on August 16, 2017",Good protection for my son's 13 inch MacBook Air. Reasonable price.
"on December 27, 2017",Looks exactly as pictured. Screen protector was cheaply made.
"on November 12, 2017","I have had this case for about 7 months now and it has worked phenomenally. Unfortunately, the corner on the bottom part of the case just broke off so I will have to order a new one. I really enjoy the keyboard cover, it protects my keys from getting unwanted gunk in them! Really pretty color as well."
"on December 7, 2016","Only problem, the keyboard cover has the letter and number slightly uncentered then it causes a double vision effect, it would be better or not to print the letters (letting the cover transparent) or making the cover not transparent."
"on November 17, 2017",Excellent product. Gives me just the right amount of grip. Looks stylish. Only issue with it is that the top sometimes pops loose when I open the laptop. Just have to be careful when I open it.
"on January 24, 2018",Product fit as expected. The case snaps on securely. The screen protector isn't a perfect fit but it's close enough and isn't noticeably too small.
"on December 12, 2017","very good. there are so many MacBooks around once the kids get here, this helps me find mine at a glance"
"on May 29, 2017","I bought another one and It doesn't fit like the other color does, so one edge is detached. Doesn't make sense to me considering the other color fits perfect. Anyways, I LOVE the one that fits! I attached pictures to give you an idea what the materials are"
"on September 23, 2016","Looks very nice. I like the matte finish however, it attracts fingerprints like crazy. One con is the laptop doesn't fully close because the case is touching sides but it's a very small space, probably not even noticeable to most and doesn't effect the function of the case and it doesn't keep the laptop from sleeping. Easy installment. I wasn't able to put the screen protector on because the stickers left residue and paper but I really just wanted the case and keyboard cover anyways."
"on August 27, 2017","Very nice, slim case. Came on time and in great condition. I think this is a very aesthetically pleasing case. The color is very true to the picture. 4/5 because I think this case is more for protecting against scratches, but wouldn't really help absorb any shock from a real drop."
"on January 11, 2018","This case is wonderful! I really don't have any complaints except for the screen protector that came with it and the microfiber wipe. The wipe ended up flaking everywhere and even after I finally got it all off it some how showed up again under the screen protector which I ended up just throwing away. Other than that, nice color, nice feel, nice fit!!"
"on November 10, 2016",loved the case especially how cheap it was. It also arrived so fast ! The only thing i didn't really like about it is that the keyboard every time i type it pops off thats not cool but other then that i am happy w/ my new accessories.
"on December 12, 2017",Looks good and hopefully will provide some protection.
"on January 25, 2018",Pro:- Nice fit- Smooth feel- Laptop does not overheat- Easy to put on- Not too heavyCons:- Didn't use the keyboard cover because it dimmed the light and made it hard too type- screen protecter left a bit of space on the side (barely noticable)
"on April 6, 2017","Stains/fingerprints show up very easily.  Color is a little different than pictured.  FIts good, and protects the computer.  I am satisfied."
"on July 19, 2017",Very good everything fits great and I loved my color.
"on January 29, 2018","Super pretty and protective. Love that it comes with a keyboard cover and a screen protector. My only dislike is that it gets dirty very fast. If you touch with oily fingers or anything short of perfectly clean hands, you can see everything on the case. Very smooth finish though, and definitely a great price."
"on September 7, 2017","Color is exactly how it looked online. I LOVE the feel of the case.  Snapped on very easily to my MacBook Air (A1466)  The only reason that I can't give it 5 stars is that there was a piece of plastic chipped off the bottom from the start.  It's a small piece on one edge and it still snapped on, so I'll see how it holds up.  Overall, happy for the price paid."
"on February 11, 2017","One of the better brands I feel from other  reviews and web sites however and the  top cover easily slips off but the bottom cover is very secure. In fact so well fitted and secure the Apple genius was afraid that it would break during removal for service.  When I tried,  it broke coming off. Fortunately I had already ordered a new cover.  nice color options."
"on August 21, 2017","Great price, and does the trick.I needed to update my cover after years of an old hard case. This is durable and I love the clear! It gets some dust in it but is otherwise wonderful!"
"on August 1, 2017","Great product, However the top cover keeps slipping off. It's a little to big, but it still makes the lap top look lit! üòéüî•"
"on December 16, 2016","I love this product, and it fits perfectly and doesn't crack like I had experienced with similar cases in the past. One thing to keep in mind is that it muffles the sound a bit. Besides that, everything fits and looks great! I especially love the keyboard protector, and love how it doesn't slide off the keyboard at all.Great buy! Definitely recommend."
"on January 29, 2018",This fit my MacBook Air perfectly. Great quality.
"on February 2, 2018",Gets the job done but doesn‚Äôt provide shock protection
"on October 25, 2016","The case and keyboard cover are the exact color show in the picture. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is I have had issue with the bottom cover staying fully connected, but so far hasn't really become an issue. Also, the screen protector was impossible to apply, but I bought this for the case and keyboard cover. I am very pleased, and I have received many compliments."
"on December 18, 2016","I like the outer case's feel, fit, and color. Looks cute and feels durable. The keyboard cover is really cute and I like the feel of the rubber, but it does make the keys a bit harder to press and it does slide around a little bit, so that part is a little disappointing. Overall I like the case a lot though, and feel like it does the job of protecting it"
"on January 7, 2018","Got a new laptop for Christmas and needed a case. It included: a top and bottom case, screen protector, a screen wipe, bumpers for the bottom to prevent sliding, and the keyboard cover. I gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more color choices."
"on January 23, 2017","it does the job. I don't travel with it so i can not contest to how strong it is for someone who travel a lot. The only thing is that i do type better without the keyboard cover, so if I'm not in a rush to type something up, i usually keep it one.  Its easy to put on and i really love the color. you are still able to see the apple logo if you care about  it."
"on October 27, 2017","Bought the grey case and it looks great, but fell apart after a couple months. However, I emailed customer service and they responded in a great and professional manner. Received a brand new replacement case for no cost in a couple of days after telling them about what happened. Highly recommend."
"on January 21, 2018",Very thin case. But good for protecting against scratches. Would not purchase the case if you are prone to dropping things. This would not protect against that.
"on June 21, 2017",Great product but the picture shows the apple sign on it but there is no apply sign. There is not even an open space so that you can see the apple sign from the computer.
"on October 8, 2017","I really like this product! It arrived quickly, it was easy to put on, and when I received it the color was exactly what I thought it would be! The only thing I would say is the keyboard cover tends to bunch up near the space bar when I type. I'm not sure if it's the keyboard or the way I type but it doesn't bother me too much!"
"on February 5, 2017",My daughter loves this! What's cool is that it's rather transparent so she put a piece of her art underneath it and it looks really cool. The only thing is that the keyboard cover slips around a little so she is using another one.
"on January 2, 2017","Fits my MacBook Air. For the price, I am very pleased. It's comparable to the really expensive case I bought from the Apple store that ended up cracking anyway."
"on January 12, 2018",Case and keyboard cover are great. Screen protector is a little short so you will have a line on the screen from where it does not cover the entire area.
"on September 27, 2017","Hard case for the base and top fit perfectly, screen protector went on without an issue and looks very nice; however, the keyboard cover fit well but the alignment of the key lable is off so it looks a little odd."
"on October 1, 2017","I just received it. ButI like it so far. Easy to snap on the Mac air 13.3 inch. The key pad cover is working well so far but again, I just received it. The screen protector though was kinda tough to put on, I actually messed it up and had to throw it out."
"on August 22, 2017",Little tight fitting on the MacBook Air.
"on June 6, 2017","The color of the product looked spot on! However, the case tends to unclip itself out of nowhere. Overall, the product looked very nice and the keyboard sleeve fits perfectly."
"on January 31, 2018",Case was hard to get on initially and was more easily scratched than I thought. A couple of the keys had some minor deformities but nothing that would affect function.  Does what it needs to do for a good price!
"on January 11, 2018","I‚Äôm giving this 4 vs 5 stars because I haven‚Äôt had the cover long enough to see how it holds up. It seems sturdy, is attractive and fits my MAC well. The coordinating keyboard cover seems superfluous but there could be others who think it‚Äôs great. Overall I think the cover is a good value."
"on May 19, 2017",It was a gift.  She liked it
"on September 17, 2017","looks great and a good price.  Slips slightly when I pick it up.  otherwise great and would be again, good value for the money!"
"on January 1, 2018",My daughter love it !!! She even decorated it.
"on September 4, 2016",I got the rose gold color but it appeared more of a purplish tint. The keyboards color is true to rose gold. The screen protector has a lot of bubbles but maybe the application wasn't correct. Overall good deal for $14. :)
"on August 1, 2017","This case and keyboard cover go on very easily, I enjoy the color and have gotten compliments on it. The screen protector is difficult to put as there are no preparation materials to help you apply it. There are also no instructions that are included in the set. Overall it's a good product and you get what you paid for."
"on October 15, 2017",Overall satisfied except the color is way lighter than shown in pictures. It fits perfectly and has no other issues so far (3 months of use).
"on July 23, 2017","Just received. Installed easily, nice looking and keyboard cover actually fit and works for me even though I wasn't looking for one.  It's hard but pliable plastic so curious how it will hold up with regular use but was inexpensive so can even order a few a year cheaper than ones in store."
"on March 2, 2017",For the price this is a great cover and I highly recommend it.
"on January 12, 2017","I purchased this for my daughter's mac air 5th edition laptop. All her friends want one now! The case fit with no problem as well as the overlay. I won't say 5 stars because we'll need to see if it offers the protection for the laptop as stated. I have a warranty, but hopefully this case won't have me using it!"
"on December 19, 2016","If you're not great at putting the screen protector on then don't get this deal.I like it overall but I wish that it'd have some sort of direction on how to put it on. It fits my laptop but I feel like it's not secure too well. Overall, shipping wise it came in really quick, so that is why I gave it 4 stars! (:"
"on November 14, 2016","At first when putting this on, it didn't seem like it was gonna attach to the edges of the computer but eventually it did and hopefully it stays attached. Was a little disappointed that the color was not a darker wine/maroonish color like the picture depicted but it'll do. I do really like the the matte texture though."
"on June 6, 2017",It comes and looks as described. Everything it says it brings comes. My only issue is that it is a bit loose (i've gotten used to it but it's still annoying at first) and it gets dirty really quick so be prepared to clean it daily/weekly (baby wipes work to clean it quickly).
"on November 14, 2017","I love this case! The only issue I had with it and still have is that it comes off of the sides randomly and you just have to click it back into place , but it does the job !"
"on May 8, 2017",The case worked great. I did not use the keyboard and screech protector so I don't know how well they worked.The apple symbol did not show through as much as I had expected according to the picture in the ad.
"on February 12, 2018","The case fits perfect and the color is what it looks like online. However, the keyboard cover does not match up with the letters on my actual keyboard which is someone annoying but for this being so cheap im not mad about it. I just have to keep my keypad light off so I dont see my letters showing through."
"on October 30, 2017",Works well
"on September 27, 2017",Good cover for Mac book air.
"on December 12, 2017","Was a little worried when I first saw the case by itself because it is slightly translucent, but once I put it one, it looks and feels great! Keyboard cover once made the tips of my fingers black, but right now, it is not staining my fingers."
"on November 16, 2017","I only use the top cover to have something protecting my laptop form my stickers so they're not actually on my laptop... fits well, the bottom part I tried putting it on and fit a little loosely, but I'm only using it cosmetically not really for actual protection purposes."
"on November 13, 2017","A nice case, but perhaps not the most durable. I had a crack in the corner of the plastic case before I even owned this case for a month. But overall, a nice and slim-fitting case for the price. I definitely enjoy the more matte finish to this case as well."
"on April 5, 2017",The case is exactly as pictured and fits well on the PC. I was happy with the color. Unfortunately there bottom of case came in cracked however the company was able to send replacement quickly and followed up with me to confirm satisfaction.
"on January 16, 2017",So the reason I'm not giving this cover 5 stars is because one end won't snap on like the rest do (even though my model MacBook is listed as the model that this cover is made for) and it really bothered me but regardless the cover is really nice and the keyboard cover fit perfectly. Haven't tried on the screen protector but I don't think I will.
"on October 8, 2017","Bought this for my girlfriend for her Macbook Air and it snaps on easily plus provides great coverage. However, I am only giving four stars due to the screen protector which came with a tiny squeege that didn't really help with getting rid of the bubbles once we tried applying the screen protector."
"on June 13, 2017",The texture is nice. I like the soft plastic even if it shows the oil marks from my finger tips. The keyboard cover is nice as well. The only problem is the top cover will not fully clip on. So the top cover will slide off occasionally.
"on March 27, 2017","Did not have any trouble placing this on my Mac, just viewing the video was enough instruction. I did buy the rose gold casing, compared to the picture the case was a little darker.  The keyboard protector was a little plastic feeling for my taste but it is all personal preference."
"on January 2, 2018",Pretty. The color of The case doesnt match The keyboard that well. It came in perfect state and with:CASEKeyboard protectorSCRREN PROTECTOROne clothAnd four extra stickies for The protector
"on February 13, 2018","A little loose, the bottom slides off pretty frequently on the MacBook Air. It is also a fingerprint magnet. But other than that, it looks great and has a nice texture and usually doesn't get in the way."
"on April 11, 2017",Good price and quality
"on August 15, 2017","The case was delivered right in time and the color is beautiful-- just as it looks online. The only minor issue is the part of the case that attaches to the bottom of the laptop has a sharp edge that scratches my wrist when typing sometimes. Regardless, I'm still really happy with the product!"
"on February 5, 2017","This is my second case of this type I've ordered. The first one was light blue and lasted quite a while. I ordered black this time because the blue one got dirty, but when I received it, the case seemed to be more charcoal grey than black. It's not that big of a deal, just not what I expected."
"on August 27, 2016","This is a really good cover for the price.  Item fits my Mac perfectly and the keyboard cover is pretty cool as well.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the screen protector isn't really worth it.  I took it off after a few hours of placing it on my computer.  Other than that, it's well worth the price I paid."
"on February 6, 2018","I love how easy it was to apply and the keyboard protector is the bomb! I don't like how easily it shows fingerprints and smudges, but love the color and overall durability."
"on December 20, 2016","This set makes it seem like i got a new mac altogether! It fit perfectly. The case is easy to clean. I would've given 5 stars, but the keyboard cover does bother me. It lays on top of the keys so it can slide at times. Its a minor annoyance that doesn't take away from the product as a whole"
"on March 27, 2017","This is wonderful! But the reason for the 4 stars, the keyboard cover doesn't fit properly. And it's too bad because it's soooo cute! But the shell not too thin, but adds a cute touch!"
"on January 12, 2018","Great case, beautiful pink color, hard shell protection and easy to snap into place. The keyboard cover makes it harder to type so I discarded that but SO worth it for the price especially. Love it"
"on September 6, 2017","It's everything you could imagine and gets the job done while looking stylish. I just wish it came with some cloth to wipe away and oil stains from my hands bc, as someone with sweaty palms, it's easy to see where you last touched the cover. Besides that, great product (would buy again)."
"on July 31, 2017",I was very worried when I was putting this case on the top was extremely tight and I had to file one of the clips because excess plastic. When I finally got the case on it was quite heavy but it was pretty good quality and super nice feeling I'm hoping the case will stretch out over time
"on January 16, 2017",It's a better fit than my previous purchase ( and returned item) from other maker. I have no complains except that keyboard cover letters are way too light color that I cannot see them when I placed on it. I ended up using my previous cover from other MacBook that I just happened to own.
"on December 18, 2017","Love it. the only downside is the Apple logo is covered and it's not easily seen through the case, if that's something you care about."
"on December 14, 2016",I love the case. The color is exactly as it looks in the picture and it fits my MacBook Air perfectly. My only complaint is the keyboard cover does not line up with the letters on the keyboard. It gives a look of double letters on the keyboard which kind of threw me off. I just decided not to use the keyboard cover. Other than that I am very pleased with this purchase.
"on January 16, 2018",Just got the light pink case and I love it. It feels very nice and smooth and I am happier with the keyboard cover than I thought I would be. I think the case would be nicer with the apple shape cut out on the top so you can always see the apple symbol.
"on July 23, 2017",Great fit so far looks good on Mac my daughter loves that she can see the apple on back when lit. Don't give all 5 stars because it took longer to get it than originally expected.
"on October 16, 2017",Cracked about two months later on the side but probably mostly because of how much I use it.
"on December 27, 2017",Great sturdy case and shipped promptly.
"on August 31, 2017","So far so good! No issues yet really. The only thing that was/is a bit awkward is the keyboard cover's a bit curled so it isn't laying entirely flat yet, but does appear to be improving. I bought it mostly for the outter case though, and like I said- so far so good!"
"on January 9, 2018","The case is good. But the bottom case gets really dirty so fast and isn‚Äôt easy to clean. The keyboard cover doesn‚Äôt fit properly and doesn‚Äôt align correctly with the actually keys. The screen protector is good, you just be have to make sure you put it on correctly."
"on April 19, 2017","Case is very smooth and clipped on easily! The keyboard cover fits perfectly as well. Haven't put on the screen protector yet but seems ver good quality. 4 starts because one corner of the case had a slight crack in it when received. Otherwise, good buy!"
"on January 18, 2018",Does the job well..
"on October 9, 2017","Paint started to chip within a few months, but besides that it is a good way to protect your laptop."
"on February 10, 2017","While not the snuggest fit, I'm satisfied with the purchase. It fits my MacBook Air good enough to stay put and protect it. The keyboard protector is a little awkward but not enough to prevent me to use it. Would buy again and recommend to anyone looking at this type of product."
"on August 7, 2017","Beautiful color. Great quality. I loved that it came with a screen protector. The only reason I give it a 4 is it is extremely difficult to take off once you put it on. However, I would certainly re-buy this product."
"on October 7, 2017","This is my third time ordering from this company. You get what you pay for, so theres no reason to complain. The longest my cases have lasted were about 6 months."
"on January 7, 2017",The shell fits perfectly. I just wish the Apple logo showed through better.
"on November 24, 2017",This is a great product!! Easy to put on and super slim! Only issue we had was the glass protector. We bought 2 of these and we ended up having one computer with out a screen protector.
"on January 12, 2018",Daughter loves it. Just as described.
"on November 19, 2017","The case is very durable, but after a month of use, the corners started to crack and the rubber bearing strips off. The keyboard protectors do their job, but sacrifice audio quality (the speakers are muffled), and typing is a little uncomfortable at first."
"on October 30, 2017","I like my laptop and keyboard cover. Takes some getting used to, typing on the silicon keyboard, but not a bad purchase."
"on September 12, 2017",Really beautiful color exactly as pictured. However the white footpads underneath came off after a couple of months and left a lot of sticky residue behind. You could try gluing them back on as they fall off.
"on January 25, 2018","Love the whole package. Looks great ! Protects my laptop and the keyboard . The screen protector is a tad bit too small, it leaves a very small area unprotected but not enough for me not to use it. I love the color though."
"on July 9, 2017","I bought this case mostly because I wanted to be able to put stickers on my laptop without harming it. I love the green. I also bought a sleeve with this case, and the case makes it a little hard to fit my MacBook into the sleeve...but I suppose this is what you settle for when you want your laptop protected."
"on August 15, 2017","simple t install, attractive colors, thin.Delivered on time. The seller reached out to find out how satisfied I was which is a plus. Why 4 stars? Not sure. I have not used it long enough to say that it will be sturdy through out the daily use. Otherwise very good product and a great seller."
"on January 5, 2018","Fits perfectly on my 13"" MacBook Air.  The keyboard silicone cover fits well too, but I have discovered that the back-lighting from the Mac isn't allowed through to illuminate the keys.  If it had, it would be a 5 Star review."
"on January 19, 2018","I love the color and the case overall. Sometimes the case comes a bit loose and has to be snapped back on, and the screen cover that came with it was a little difficult to put on so I ended up not using it. I love the keyboard cover a lot more than I thought I would!"
"on December 29, 2016","Overall, the case is great. I had an issue with a defect in the coating but the company was great to work with and the fixed the problem quickly. I only gave it 4 stars because the Apple logo doesn't shine through as much as I'd like."
"on March 8, 2017",i ordered this yesterday and it arrived today. that was exciting. i absolutely love the color. it's true to picture. i would deff reccomend this to someone looking to buy a cover for their macbook air.
"on January 20, 2017","This is my second Mosiso case. Unfortunately, I was a tad bit more disappointed with this one. It came with some small cracks on the edges of the case. It didn't bother me enough to go through the hassle of returning it, but I can't give 5 stars for that reason."
"on February 8, 2017",The cover fits perfectly on my MacBook Air but the screen protector covers the screen and the framing around the screen which isn't flush with the actual screen so it looks bad! The keyboard covers works as expected with no issues other than the screen protector.
"on December 13, 2016","I was hoping it would be darker but I still like it. The keyboard is nice and fits perfectly. The bottom part snapped in place easily but the top part was a bit harder to do. Now that everything is in place though, I'm definitely a fan of this case for the price."
"on March 6, 2017",I love the case.. Esp. The fact that it has a stand. I gave a four star because I wanted the red which was out of stock and had to settle for the purple. It is really nice but red is my favorite color. I'm impress.
"on October 28, 2017",The case itself feels a bit cheap but it does the job. I loved that it came with a screen protector and the key board dust thing. If it didn‚Äôt feel so thin and if it was bit dirty when I got it I would‚Äôve given it 5 stars but overall good deal.
"on July 31, 2017","The case is great and fits perfectly, but my only issue was that the keyboard cover didn't quite match up with the letters on the actual keyboard. That's not a huge deal to me since I was really only interested in the case part!"
"on January 29, 2017","This is a great laptop case if you're just looking for a sleek and nice look, and just want to your laptop to have minimum protection. It actually cracked one me and broke although I take very good care of my laptop. All in all I would give it 4 stars, you get what you pay for."
"on March 14, 2017","It's not mint green, it's a transparent blue. I like the case but this is my second Mosiso case. They are very thin & easy to break but I brought a sleeve for this one. So far so good."
"on February 6, 2017","Great case, good for the price. Is pretty opaque so can't see the apple sign through the case super well if that matters to you! The screen cover fits perfectly, as does the keyboard cover. The airy blue is also a really nice blue color! Would recommend!"
"on November 2, 2017",I purchased the clear case and it seems super great for its price. The only issue I had with it was that the right corner doesn't fit my laptop properly so there's a little gap. I'm assuming this is probably a random manufacturing mishap.
"on January 28, 2018","Amazing cover! This fits perfectly on my MacBook! (Air 13‚Äù) However, the screen protector it comes with did not fit on my screen fully. A bit disappointed. Otherwise, great quality for just anyone looking for a standard package like this."
"on April 21, 2017","I'm rating this purchase as 4 stars because the first cover I received did not stay firmly attached to the top of the laptop. However,  I contacted customer service and they sent a new cover which works perfectly. I am very pleased with the cover and the support I received from customer service."
"on November 9, 2017","Every part is this order works perfectly except for the cover that goes on the lid of the laptop. It pops off constantly. It appears that there‚Äôs only one latch that keeps it on the lid. Other than that, love the product and the color!"
"on February 18, 2017",The case fits good. The keyboard cover doesn't really do anything for me as it makes typing very mushy and I prefer having some feedback when clicking the keys. The only benefit I can think of is that it prevents dust from going under the keyboards.
"on January 16, 2017","This case is beautiful , color is just like the picture. The only problem I have is the bottom of the case, it doesn't seem to fit my MacBook Air."
"on January 1, 2018","Great case for the price, but it is definitely a reflection of the cost. The case does make my laptop feel twice as heavy, but worth it for how protected it is. The keyboard cover is fantastic and stays on well."
"on August 11, 2017",Same exact case as Ibenzer? Works fine. Fits MacBook Air 13 inch perfectly. Kids liked the keypad cover.
"on September 29, 2016","The cover for the Mac fit well.  I couldn't install plastic screen cover correctly, but didn't try very hard because it's really not necessary."
"on December 18, 2017",The hard cover puts some weight on my 13inch MacBookAir. Great material. I didn't apply the clear plastic cover well but it's fine. I am not sure if it'll leave sticky residue yet (afraid to find out!)
"on March 22, 2017",I ordered it for my son ...he seems happy with it it looks durable and the Mac air seems protected with it including the screen protector that came with it..I like the color very much !!!! And the price was great! !!
"on February 10, 2017",perfect shade of pale pink. My biggest complaint is that it made my laptop much heavier and that it doesnt quite fit perfectly onto laptop. The bottom shell keeps popping out. It does sit snug onto my laptop and i don't worry about it falling off.
"on May 14, 2017","I'm giving this case 4 stars bc, I like the case but it leaves fingerprint stains on the case, which is very tedious to try to get rid of. It happens every time I grab the case so I wish the case was made with a different type of plastic material."
"on January 25, 2018","This is a solid case. While I'm not a fan of the keyboard cover, the case itself is good enough to protect my laptop from scratches and stains. Can't beat the price either."
"on October 10, 2017","Really nice. Comes with keyboard cover and surprisingly, a screen protector which fits perfectly. Great purchase. Four stars only because the material of the case is easily scratchable."
"on September 15, 2017","Nice black case, easily clips on, the keyboard cover is nice but the light doesn't shine through"
"on January 15, 2018","The case was good except for the fact that the bottom case didn't fit my laptop perfectly when it was open.  Also with the keyboard cover, I can't see the keys very well so I don't use it.  But for the most part it is a good product."
"on May 15, 2017","I have a 13"" Macbook Air and this mostly fits it. The bottom portion doesn't fully snap on. It stays on the laptop for the most part and does what it's supposed to do but it's not quite the perfect fit."
"on March 11, 2017",The case is quite nice. It has a great feel to it and looks good. The only drawback is tat it appears that the part covering the back of the screen adds some weight to it and the hinge does not want to stay in place. The screen tends to fall further open/closed depending on the angle.
"on September 6, 2017","Case is amazing and so so soft and matte. I ordered the serenity blue color! The keyboard protector fits perfectly. However, I will say that the screen protector was damaged when I received it other than that I would recommend getting the case!"
"on February 11, 2018","Cute case for the price!  Seems sturdy, and attached to the laptop easily. Looks nice, too!  If I could, I‚Äôd give it 4.5 Stars, only because the screen protector that came with the case was damaged."
"on July 26, 2017",The case & keyboard cover are great.  The screen saver is. waste.  It wouldn't stay in place.  I gave it to my granddaughter to cut up for craft projects.
"on April 16, 2017","Easy to put on the hard case and it covers very well.  The only issue is that the keyboard cover was delivered somewhat bent up on the right side, so it doesn't lay completely flat at the top, but its still does the job well."
"on January 17, 2018","Kinda had a paint smell to it that took a few days to air out, I don‚Äôt know how protective it would be in an instance if you dropped the computer but will protect from scratches etc."
"on February 23, 2017","great use for a temporary laptop cover. Totally worth the money.  I would get it without the keyboard protector, because it gets in the way of how fast you type. I personally don't like that.  Other than that, the case itself is very nice."
"on September 10, 2017","It's a very cute and protective case. It included a screen protector too! There's just a little tiny problem with the keyboard case, it slips off easily if you turn your laptop sideways lol but otherwise than that, it does it job."
"on October 26, 2017","Love the case ! However, due to the color it does get dirty easy but definitely protects Macbook from potential  scratches."
"on October 7, 2017","Everything you need to protect your Mac is included from Mosiso, and each piece is high quality. My only suggestion would be to include one more contact point for the case to clip onto the screen to have it fit more securely."
"on June 22, 2017","Good quality, but the color is not mint, is more green, still cute though."
"on January 17, 2018","Installation is pretty difficult, and removing it is difficult as well since youre trying not to scratch your expensive macbook air, but once its on its a pretty nice product. I enjoy the keyboard cover that was included"
"on April 19, 2017","Great deal. Beautiful case for a great price. My only complaint is the keyboard cover could fit a little bit more snug, it is pretty loose in some areas. Overall great deal though!!"
"on August 22, 2017",It looks great! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it un-snaps close to the space bar sometimes when I'm typing. Everything else fit. Love the keyboard cover as well. I haven't put on the screen protector just yet.
"on December 9, 2017",As described!
"on February 2, 2017",This case is really pretty and true to color. The keyboard topper fits perfectly and it is still easy to type. My problem is that the bottom piece does not snap in on the back. Overall it works well and I've gotten lots of compliments on it!
"on June 15, 2017",I love the feel and color of this case. The only problem is that parts of the case pop off when I move the computer around but it doesn't affect the integrity of the case. The screen protector is also very good and prevents any scratches/smudges.
"on September 26, 2017",Fits great. Very sleek and like that the apple still shows through it. I just wished it had a clip in the center near the camera. This is where you grab to open the laptop and am afraid it is eventually going to stretch out or break.
"on December 25, 2017","I like the smooth outside and how it‚Äôs only plastic on the inside. The screen protector was kind of small omfor the screen and the case has some sharp touches on some parts of the case, but other than this it‚Äôs great. I love it"
"on May 14, 2017","Case arrived very quickly, the color is even prettier than the picture. Only minor complaint I have is that the keyboard cover could fit a little bit better. Overall, looks great and would buy again."
"on January 28, 2018",works well
"on March 15, 2017","I love the keyboard cover, I love the color, I love the protection... my only area of concern is that the hard case shows every finger mark.  Not a fan of that...what can I use to clean the cover, but not hurt it?"
"on September 1, 2017","The color is awesome. I don't have any trouble with it. The only think I am not fond of is the fact that the keyboard cover is slightly off than my actual keyboard so it makes it look blurry. Other than that, I love the product."
"on May 18, 2017","Love the case and keyboard cover, wasn't aware the speakers in a MacBook Air are partially under the keyboard though so the super comfortable and cute keyboard cover does somewhat muffle or mess with the sound."
"on September 25, 2016","This is just fine. It fits well and also comes with a screen protector. They keyboard protector makes it a little harder to type--not as comfortable as my previous one. The plastic is thin, but snaps on easily and does the job of basic protection."
"on January 5, 2017","Shipping was fast ! The actual case fit perfectly and it feels really nice. The only thing was that the screen protector was a tiny bit small and the keyboard protector although felt nice, was hard to press down on the keys."
"on October 19, 2017",Love it - only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is that the little tab buttons to place on the bottom ( on top of laptop bottom ‚Äúfeet‚Äù would stay put.  Doesn‚Äôt affect use of the case or cause inconvenience.
"on February 1, 2017","Very sturdy and protective. However, the keyboard cover is so light that it makes it kind of  hard to see the keys. If I get another one, I will get a darker color to hide dirt and so that I can see the keys more easily."
"on September 10, 2017",It works very well and keeps scratches off! Only problem I have with it is the top case falls off at first but eventually will somewhat mold onto the laptop. I would get one of these again.
"on September 21, 2017",The laptop case works really well and it was pretty easy to put on as well as the keyboard cover. But it was kind of hard to put the screen protector on. It would be better if they put instructions on how to put it on.
"on September 25, 2017",The color was really great and met my expectations from the website. I appreciate the easyness of mounting the case and screen protection. Only drawback was that I couldn't get a key cover matching my Swedish keyboard.
"on January 26, 2018",Fits great and works great. Adds a nice touch.
"on January 10, 2017",Overall it is a great product and I like it.  It fits Macbook air perfectly and looks good.  Keyboard cover fitted well; I wasn't successful in attaching the screen protector but it may be something I did incorrectly.
"on July 11, 2017","I really like the case. fits perfectly but upon removing the case, where the head phone jack is located one of the tabs had cracked. now my case feels loose. overall the case is perfect. love the color"
"on January 25, 2017","I love it, although it seems to pop off a little from the lap top in one area occasionally. Other than that it is wonderful!! It is better than the one a third party Apple store sold me when I bought the laptop. I did not use the screensaver though.Suzanne"
"on September 13, 2017",We purchased two cases and they look very nice.  The only problem we had was that the front of the bottom case was very difficult to get on. Overall we are happy now that the case fits it just took a bit of attength
"on March 7, 2017","I received exactly what I was looking for, and all for a great price!!! The Keyboard cover was a little too bent on one side but still usable. Thanks for a great product."
"on August 6, 2017","Great case! My MacBook looks great. However, the screen protector was a pain to put on and I eventually gave up and took it off."
"on January 5, 2018",The color is a perfect match to the item description. It arrived quickly. I do wish that the case snapped on to my laptop a little better and that the keyboard cover fit better. But for the price point it‚Äôs great!
"on November 18, 2017",Fits the computer exact but it is very hard to take off.
"on January 17, 2017","The case fits great. The keyboard cover isn't the greatest. It doesn't exactly match the Macbook Air 13 inch. When the keyboard lights are  on, there's a terrible glare. Overall, a good item to buy for the price."
"on November 26, 2016","Very good value for the money!  It was a little difficult to get the top part on, but once on, it fits perfectly.  I like the keyboard being the same color as the case.  The case looks great and feels snug and secure."
"on October 13, 2017",Fits reasonable well.
"on December 7, 2016","This is a great case. It is smooth to the touch, fits pretty well, and the Apple logo shines nicely through the case. You can access all of the ports without removing the case and it does not get scratched easily."
"on February 2, 2017","The case required a bit more force than expected to fully clip onto the computer, but it appears sturdy without adding too much bulk or weight to the computer. Shipped and arrived quickly. Color as advertised."
"on February 8, 2018","The case is super sturdy, yet very light in weight compared to another case I‚Äôve bought from another seller. I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars because it‚Äôs a bit hard to clean off oil based stains from chips or whatever."
"on February 9, 2017","I think you get a lot for the price of this cover. I've only had it for a day, but even if I had to replace it within the year I would get it again because I like the color options and the feel of the case."
"on September 19, 2017","The case is nice, color is as in picture, the only thing is the type cover slides a little and by the right ""command"" button and the external cover is minimally larger"
"on March 20, 2017","Very solid case.  I didn't realize it wouldn't be as ""transparent"" as the spec cases, but that's okay.  It fits and stays on ... that is the most important this to me."
"on April 8, 2017","Nice color and I love the keyboard cover that comes with it, but the case is a pain to take off!"
"on July 6, 2017",Really like how it adds a pop of color to my macbook. Fits exactly like it says.
"on January 21, 2017",cute case with a cute keyboard cover! the only problem i had with it was that the top cover didn't fit so i had to file the side so it could fit. also the screen protector came dented so i didn't use it.
"on June 14, 2017","the case is great!! i got it in the color marsala red. it was easy to put on my macbook, and it arrived quickly to my home. i'm just trying to get adjusted to the keyboard."
"on January 13, 2018",This case looks great! The bottom snaps off a tiny bit but not too big a deal.
"on November 3, 2016",Fits perfectly on my Mac! Love the color and style. The keyboard and screen protector are a nice bonus! Only complaint is that the screen protector was a bit tricky to put on so ultimately ended up not using it.
"on September 27, 2017","I like the color and it fit my MacBook Air. It feels very nice. However, the letters on the keyboard cover wiped off within 2 weeks of purchase and the case got dirty very quickly after my purchase."
"on August 7, 2017",its a perfect fit but the only reason i cant give it 5 stars is because the bottom half of the case is cracked:( good for the price though
"on February 11, 2018","It fits perfectly, the color and everything else is okay. The only problem is any time you touch your finger mark is all over it and they don‚Äôt go away"
"on February 1, 2018","The top part didn't snap into place like the bottom however, it hasnt come off and seems to still fit snug. So far so good."
"on December 17, 2017","Thanks Justin, the laptop case is great, although the screen protector came in a little bent, idk like a little part of it looked bent for some reason, other than that everything else was great !"
"on December 26, 2016","Amazing product you won't be disappointed, just having a little struggle snapping and keeping the top cover on. Shipping and service is amazing!!"
"on February 22, 2017",I had trouble putting the screen protector on but otherwise loving the case and keyboard cover!Update* The keyboard cover does not lay flat. It has already started to fall apart. Get what you pay for I guess!
"on September 30, 2017",Great product! Have it on my MacBook Air! Only thing that I had a problem with is that part of the case broke off a couple weeks after I bought it! Other than that I recommend it!
"on December 31, 2017",This was a gift for my daughter. I loved how easy the case fit onto her Mac. The color is beautiful and the screen protector is a plus.
"on August 21, 2017",The only problem is the keyboard. I cant see the keys at night as Im used to without the case. You should develop with a space that allow us to write in the dark.
"on April 19, 2017",super soft and easy to put on! The color is great and subtle. My only complaint is that the keyboard cover didn't come and I was told I get a refund or replacement and that has not happened.
"on November 29, 2016","Love the color!  The keyboard cover fits well but the screen protector that came with it didnt fit quite well, I still have it on, looks fine. Good overall though! I would purchase another color."
"on February 16, 2018",doesn't stay on sometimes but overall nice for the price
"on March 13, 2017",Took a while to get it one correctly but it works well. Nice color too. Bottom piece pops off and on a little but nothing that is to bothersome.
"on December 29, 2017","It is an okay case for the price. The keyboard cover doesn't match up perfectly, but it's only noticeable when my keyboard brightness is on."
"on November 11, 2016","I think that it was great. The colors are beautiful and they make my mac look colorful without going over the top. However, I was not happy with the fact that the screen protector was not included."
"on December 23, 2016","The hardcover case and the keyboard cover are so cute and protective. I love that you can still see the apple logo through the case and the keyboard cover is really easy to put on, it takes a bit to get used to when typing, but like I said it is easy to put on so taking it off and putting it back on if you will be typing for a while will be no problem. The only thing keeping me from giving this order 5 stars is the screen protector. I am usually really good at applying these things, but this screen protector had an insane amount of bubbles no matter how man times you tried to reapply so I had to just dispose of it. Other than the screen protector, this bundle is well worth the affordable price."
"on December 4, 2016","Went on easy, I liked the color and the keyboard cover as well. Screen protector was easy to put on. Arrived with a small piece cracked off on the back but I didn't even notice it right away."
"on February 22, 2017","Great product, however there is a little black speck that drives me crazy on the case! It's inside the plastic so there's no getting it out so it just sits there and stares at me all day."
"on January 12, 2017",This is a great product I'm in love with the color. It came with a matching keyboard cover and screen protector which is great. This product did not come with instructions so  it was difficult to put on my mac. Also this case scratches easy which I wasn't pleased with.
"on November 28, 2017",Works perfect
"on January 26, 2018","Easily applicable case. My minor problem is that it's not as black in real life as it is on the picture. If I knew that earlier, I would buy a different color."
"on March 13, 2017",Looks good and easy to put on.
"on July 25, 2017","wish the top case wouldnt stain so easily leaving every finger mark on there but love everything else about the case, great color selection"
"on April 24, 2017",Protects my Mac :)
"on August 12, 2017",Pretty but heavyI bought it for my friend's bday gift
"on March 7, 2017","Keyboard cover is great and fits like a glove, but the bottom part of the cover could use four extra clips (two in front, two in back). Nice matte texture and color."
"on November 8, 2016",cute case and i love the color. the only reason i didn't rate it with 5 stars is because it can get dirty fast. i have a black laptop sleeve and the edges of the case are turning black from the sleeve rubbing up against it. other than that i love it and the keyboard protector.
"on December 23, 2017",Love it! No instructions included though.üôÅ figured it out quickly enough. I love the color and definitely recommend it.
"on May 20, 2017",Fits perfectly... only complaint I have is that the keypad cover doesn't allow the lights from the keyboard to shine thru at night...
"on June 22, 2017","The case itself is amazing, but the keyboard cover is not the greatest, it's hard to type using the keyboard cover. The color is the same as the picture. The screen protector is very good."
"on February 1, 2017","Nice cover for Mac Air. Easy to install. Has a velvety feel to it and feels soft to the touch. Only dislike is, the oils from your hands and fingers are difficult to clean off."
"on December 18, 2017",Really nice.
"on December 30, 2016",Love the soft matte feel and the color. Came with everything and extra white circle stickers if the ones on the bottom half of the case fall off. It;s hard to take off though
"on November 17, 2016","Plastic hard case four starsKeyboard cover 3 starsScreen protectors 2 starsThe plastic cover was not difficult to put on my MacBook air, it is soft to the touch, and the apple logo glows through the case which is something I wanted. However, the fit is not 100% which is why I am not giving it 5 stars. The edges don't come all the way close together making my MacBook look as though it has a a gap when closed.The keyboard cover makes it difficult to push down on the buttons. I am hoping it is something that changes throughout everyday use. It does serve the purpose for keeping the keyboard clean of dust and dirt. However, when in class and trying to type something fast because of the difficulty of typing I make a lot of typos and I find myself taking it off.Screen protector does not fit 13 inch screen perfect. I am thinking it is for the purpose of when you take it off it is not as difficult? There are a lot of bubbles left which is not noticeable on the Air but I am sure you can tell on a Mac with retina display."
"on January 28, 2017",The back doesn't fit on mine.. it keeps sliding off. The too is nice though. And I loved that it came with a screen protector!
"on March 3, 2017",Took a bit of effort to snap on but is on now and looks great!
"on January 25, 2018",perfect fit. little swirl scratches but otherwise good product.
"on February 15, 2018",Itsa good one. Beautiful. However fingerprints are left when u touch it and also it came a bit cracked in side but i guess its bcs of long way of trip to me
"on December 11, 2017",I really like it!  Lightweight and the keyboard protector is a nice bonus.  The cover shows fingerprints/oil but other than that a thumbs up!
"on March 6, 2017",Absolutely love the color and feel of the case but it is impossible to get the top part to snap on.
"on September 15, 2017",it came just like the picture but the material is really fragile and it breaks easily ..it came broken from a corner ...the product is fine for the price ..is just the material.
"on August 26, 2016",fit perfectly. was impressed with the quality for how cheap it was. loved the color. screen protecter was a little hard for me to apply but i got majority of the air bubbles out. i would buy again.
"on January 28, 2018",Dont recall getting a screen protector but overall was nice
"on February 1, 2018","The case is nice, a little darker than I expected but okay.‚ÄãBut the lower case doesn't seem to fit properly; kind of falls off a little bit sometimes"
"on April 6, 2017",Breaks easily.
"on February 9, 2017",This is exactly what I wanted. Only thing that wasn't great was the screen protector. It was hard to use and I ended up just throwing it out.  Over al good buy and would buy again.
"on January 16, 2018",came very fast except the key board buttons do not line up on the top row. it is not that they don't fit it is that the buttons are mixed up
"on September 12, 2017",Great case and I love the color! The bottom looks like it does fit perfectly but it doesn't cause any issues.
"on December 20, 2017",Just as described...I will order more in different colors
"on March 20, 2017","Color was a little deceiving, but overall I really enjoy this product"
"on August 9, 2017","Fits my MacBook Air perfectly! Only thing is that it leaves fingerprints on the outside of the case, but it doesn't really bother me. All in all, it fits its purpose."
"on January 25, 2018","The product arrived quickly and the color is beautiful. However, the top portion of the case comes off at least twice a week, but it‚Äôs not a huge problem."
"on September 30, 2017",Fits perfectly fine. The only complaint I would have is that the top (snap on) white cover has a couple of small random purple dots. Other than that its pretty great
"on January 4, 2017","Fits the laptop snugly and reasonably easy to take off, however adds significant weight to the laptop.  It may or may not annoy you.  Just something to be aware of."
"on March 12, 2017","Good price, but I didn't like the keyboard cover so I just took it off. the case is nice and does its job!"
"on September 15, 2017",Should've came with tempered glass..but Eeh
"on October 17, 2016","great case and key pad cover, however the reason for 4 instead of 5 is that the screen protector was very hard to put on and i ended up not using and throwing away."
"on December 4, 2016",I really struggled to get the top of the case to stay on. I love the price and the color but I don't like the line up of the keyboard protector or the struggle to install the lid.
"on October 17, 2016",Love the color and the fact that the keyboard cover matches perfectly is a plus :) I only gave the product 4 stars because of the amount of finger prints that the case picks up
"on April 5, 2017","Great product, great price!  My daughter LOVES it!!"
"on February 4, 2017","Arrived on time, case snapped on the computer perfectly, and the keyboard cover is fine. I didn't bother with the screen protector so can't comment about that."
"on October 15, 2017","Nice case, protects from scratches.  A grip on the bottom fell off, but comes with an extra set.  Screen protector is kind of difficult to get on, but it works"
"on February 18, 2017",This was a great purchase for me. It was easy to put on and was more than what I expected. I definitely recommend that anyone who needs a case to get this one.
"on October 30, 2016",Really satisfied with my purchase. Nice looking case with a very nice smooth touch. Only one thing I didn't like. The screen protector was too small fo my MacBook Air 13'.
"on February 19, 2017",I love the color but it does tend to weigh down my screen and the keyboard get stuck but I love the color and I am very pleased with it besides those reasons.
"on February 8, 2018","Serves its purpose. Arrived in a timely manner, fits perfect & looks good."
"on March 12, 2017",The case was a perfect fit and a great color.  Very professional looking.
"on April 30, 2017",Great color. Fits perfectly on my macbook air.  Also very easy to put on.
"on December 27, 2017",Although it came out dark blue instead of black.. it made a really good present and my boyfriend loved it so therefore I‚Äôll give it a 4 stars!
"on September 25, 2016","like it a lot! the keyboard cover makes my macbook air look a bit blurry but overall i love it! good quality, also dont put the screen protector on. It will mess up your screen."
"on November 22, 2017","It doesn't snap on at the bottom properly but its still hanging on either way. Looks like great quality, and the keyboard cover isn't annoying to use at all."
"on January 1, 2018",The cover was a gift. It fit perfectly and the receiver was very pleased it also included a screen protector. They advised the color was perfect. Thank you.
"on October 6, 2016","Absolutely love it. The case came in good condition and it was easy to put on my laptop. So far, the case fits well on the laptop and the the keyboard cover is a good accessory for the laptop. Would highly recommend for anyone to buy a product from this brand."
"on March 3, 2017",Great quality and price.
"on August 13, 2017",Everything fits great
"on November 5, 2017",The cover is sturdy anddoes the job of protecting my laptop. The screen cover did not fit. It was very small.
"on May 4, 2017",I liked it.  It also has something to hold the screen.
"on August 24, 2017",It's a good purchase. Great price BUT it came in damaged. I'm sure if it didn't have a broken piece it would have been perfect product.
"on November 2, 2017","I bought it for my wife and she lives it, it's a great case in a beautiful color. I don't give it 5 stars because she said it's a little heavy."
"on January 17, 2017",Love this case everything's really nice. Would have given 5 stars but don't like the fact that finger oil seems hard to get of the case. Super minor.
"on December 8, 2016","The cover slips on easily and stays on - unlike some laptop covers I've seen/used before. Unfortunately, the black is not as dark as I'd expected, but the usefulness of the cover makes up for this. Overall, an excellent and affordable buy!"
"on January 23, 2018",I love the color and it fits my laptop perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the corners for the bottom piece were cracked.
"on August 13, 2017",Worked well. After getting tabs lined up on right side of top it snapped right on. Bottom was no problem
"on July 26, 2017",It fits better than my old one and the case seems more durable than my old one. The one star off is because it's a brighter green than the picture.
"on October 25, 2017","Ordered in Deep Teal and it‚Äôs not as dark as I expected it to be but it‚Äôs still pretty, like seafoam green. So far, it‚Äôs protective but I haven‚Äôt had it long."
"on January 9, 2017","Everything is perfect and as shown, except for the screen protector which is hard to put on, bubbles easily and just doesn't look well. This was thrown away almost immediately, but the keyboard and case are perfect!"
"on July 27, 2017",It wasn't what I expected I like it
"on August 23, 2017",Somewhat slick surface. Was hoping for a more rubbery texture to resist slipping but it will work for what I want.
"on August 13, 2017","Really good case, though the bottom portion could be a little more secure. But I definitely think it was worth it for the price!"
"on July 31, 2017",I did not receive the keyboard cover- which is what enticed me to buy- but the cover works wonders.
"on May 27, 2017",Good deal for price. Case is pretty good quality but top part of the case comes off easily. Color is true to pic.
"on June 1, 2017","Very nice stuff.The cover case, screen cover and the keyboard fitted my MacAir like a glove! Timely delivery too."
"on January 27, 2018","Very nice!, I like the fact it come with a keyboard cover."
"on January 29, 2018",So far so good. Time will tell how it holds up.
"on July 17, 2017","Great price for all you can get. However, I am leaving finger print marks on the case that are hard to get off."
"on February 14, 2018",Good value for quality product.
"on January 9, 2018",I loved how it came with a full set to cover my computer but I wish the screen would be easier to put on but all in all it‚Äôs a great cover.
"on January 21, 2017",Like everything just have a little problem with the clear plastic sheet.It will not stay in place.thanks for asking
"on February 21, 2017","The apple logo does not show through when the laptop isn't open and on. Other than that this is a great case, good quality and super cute."
"on June 26, 2017","The case is fine, but it arrived damage. A piece broke off from the edge  by the headphone jack. Still functional, though."
"on November 1, 2017",Not as opaque as I would have liked for the back plate but otherwise great buy
"on July 12, 2017",It seems to be a good looking product.  Can't say much initially.  I will know more in the next several months once I see how the product holds up to use.
"on July 20, 2017",Love the color and looks great and protects well.
"on February 14, 2017",goodddd really pretty beautifulbut keyskin there is little problem just little suckdetail was poor but good im satisfied
"on August 13, 2017","I order this, only the laptop case came in. There was no keyboard cover or screen cover. Other than that it was a great purchase."
"on January 16, 2018","Works really well - fits my MacBook Air perfectly. Makes the top a little heavy, so it tends to fall- otherwise great"
"on February 15, 2018",Very cute
"on February 17, 2017",The case is nice. It's very pigmented and it fits my case well. It's not too difficult to put it on and take it off. The keyboard cover fits properly too. So far so good.
"on May 8, 2017","This case is so cute. It's a really good deal for the price because it comes with a screen protector and the soft keypad cover. My keypad cover is nice however the letters didn't quite match up with the ones on the MacBook, which is okay, but is really noticeable when it lights up. The case color is a bit darker than my rose gold iPhone, but I don't mind."
"on February 13, 2018",I love the color and this case but the apple logo isn't cut out which is what I wanted so it looks kind of odd.
"on September 12, 2017",Excellent case!  Really like how sleek and light it is.
"on October 31, 2017",Nice
"on February 13, 2017",Bought as a gift for my sister. She loves it! Only thing she did not like is where the letters were setup on the key board.
"on December 8, 2016",Exactly what I expected. It looks good (maybe a little too dark in the green) but it protects my laptop and fits really well.
"on March 28, 2017",Fit's well ... the keyboard cover seems to stay on.
"on May 14, 2017","The white letters on the keyboard cover are hard to read, otherwise the case is a nice color and fits well"
"on January 25, 2018","It's a really smooth case and fits well. maybe more support on the sides would be good, but overall a very nice product."
"on February 8, 2018",I really liked this case! It snapped right on my laptop and I get compliments all the time on the color!
"on October 24, 2017","I had trouble getting the top half to stay on the top half of my Mac, but overall I enjoy this product and I love the color I got."
"on March 19, 2017","Love it. Keyboard cover doesn't fit exact, but it does the job."
"on November 14, 2016","It fit perfect! although the keyboard cover, is starting to fade and i just got it a couple weeks ago. I also didn't use the screen protector."
"on September 6, 2017",My daughter loves it.. goes perfect with her color scheme in her dorm room
"on February 5, 2018",Good case. Hard to remove but all around good.
"on October 17, 2017","Good quiality for a cheap price , Apple would charge double."
"on January 13, 2017","ordered it on a wednesday and got here on a friday:fast shipping , case fits and clicks perfectly with the laptop."
"on December 3, 2017",It is a nice protection for my macbook air!
"on January 19, 2018",Love the case and love the texture. Only issue I had is the letters on the key board cover are difficult to see.
"on February 16, 2017","I wish it would've came with instructions. I was confused on how to put the screen protector and the keyboard. also, the keyboard protector makes it difficult to type, in my opinion"
"on October 18, 2016","I enjoy the cover.  Pretty easy to attach. Had a little trouble getting it to stay on at first, but now it is locked in place."
"on February 27, 2017","It is a good protective case, but it would be good if the bottom part of the case stuck to the computer better."
"on December 30, 2017",It‚Äôs a nice case for the price the keyboard smells a little but overall very nice!
"on May 26, 2017","I'm very happy with this product so far... although it was not delivered in a timely manner, the case itself was easy to put on and seems to be doing the trick"
"on December 21, 2017","I love it... though it came broken on one side, other wise my macbook looks great"
"on April 17, 2017",Awesome color and gives great protection
"on June 20, 2017",Keyboard cover sometime wants to come up
"on June 22, 2017","Case was easy to put on, and the screen protecter was too! Keyboard cover fits perfectly. The only issue i've had is fingerprints staying on the case"
"on November 28, 2017","fits well although I won't be able to put any decal stickers on the case but otherwise, love the color I got."
"on September 15, 2016","So far everything fits well and the color matches, the only thing is it's a little more see through than the pictures. Not completely clear but you can definitely see through the case. Otherwise a good buy so far !!"
"on August 26, 2016","The cover is pretty good, Just the screen protecter wasn't the best and also didn't bring the little sticky thing to get out the dust."
"on April 11, 2017",Fantastic timing. Wonderful feel. Beautiful color.
"on January 6, 2017","No personal use as this was bought as a gift. However, the recipient was thrilled and it looked terrific."
"on June 4, 2017",Easy to put case on - nice quality for the money
"on September 3, 2017",Looks good and has a soft feel. Perfect for what I needed to protect my computer! Price was just right. I'd recommend buying.
"on August 24, 2017",Great. fits and solves the problem and a deal for the price.
"on January 9, 2017",I really liked this case for my MacBook. It feels and looks great. I would buy this again if I had too
"on December 17, 2017",It fits perfectly on my laptop and it matches my pink phone case. I am very pleased with my purchase.
"on August 22, 2017","It is a little dirty,but is still acceptable."
"on November 21, 2016",I like this. I didnt use the plastic screen film but the case and keyboard cover are a perfect fit1 Thanks
"on October 29, 2017",nice
"on November 10, 2017",Came a bit smudged but still looks good & I feel like it protects my computer well.
"on October 23, 2017","For a low price, I got a three-in-one deal: the case, the screen protector, and a keyboard cover."
"on January 6, 2017",Very lovely color and arrived super fast-fits the Mac perfectly and was a great price.  All good!
"on April 8, 2017","It's more of an aqua, turquoise but nonetheless pretty"
"on February 22, 2017",I love that this came with a screen protector! The case is of good quality and I like it so far.
"on June 14, 2017",It's really nice. It has a soft feel to it and it's exactly the color I wanted.
"on September 29, 2017",It comes up with the same color as mentioned in the description. It is an amazing product. :)
"on February 3, 2017",I love the color but it seems to fall off my laptop sometimes. But other than that I love it.
"on November 21, 2017",The color is totally what I want. But an angle of it was broken when I got it.
"on March 17, 2017",Great product and value.  Screen protector too but need instructions for that.
"on September 12, 2016","The keyboard cover and the case fits perfectly. However, the case can pick up fingerprints but it doesn't bother me that much."
"on September 5, 2017",Great color! Fast delivery and so far so good!
"on January 7, 2018",Everything I expected screen protector seems flimsy
"on October 31, 2017",Case had a smudge but it was supposedly new but over all it‚Äôs a good case
"on March 9, 2017",For the price this thing is great and really all one needs for protection
"on September 5, 2017",Good.
"on September 8, 2017","Works good but get covered in oil marks after minimal handling, besides that it's great"
"on January 3, 2018",I bought the ‚Äúclear ‚Äú . I only didn‚Äôt like the keyboard cover . Doesn‚Äôt fit very well .
"on January 19, 2018","Good product, the keyboard protectant is a bit tough but, still a good by."
"on December 18, 2016",Product came exactly as described! Keyboard is great but loses its ability to stick easily
"on August 19, 2017","It's really sturdy just when I got it, it was not the color I expected"
"on July 16, 2017","Case looks great, however fingerprint marks are visible."
"on March 22, 2017",My daughter loves the hard case but not to fond of the keypad covering
"on October 8, 2017",Case fits well but only issue is that instructions online are different than the ones given online.
"on January 15, 2018",It was a great case and it fit just how i wanted it too
"on January 23, 2017",They have great customer support the case is very cute and simple great color too.
"on August 24, 2016",over all it was a great case but if for some reason your laptop over heats it starts to mess with the plastic
"on November 3, 2017",Its good. Love that it comes with the screenprotector and keyboard.
"on September 12, 2017",I like this case very much. It gives my laptop a nice look and it feels durable.

"on March 28, 2017",Gift for my husband-- he loved it.
"on January 20, 2018","Keys board cover was missing, but other then that case looking nice"
"on January 18, 2017",Does what it is supposed to do. Colored keyboard protector not distracting.
"on December 10, 2016",Holding up nicely.  Fits well and keyboard cover is nice.  Would order again.
"on December 23, 2017",Fits perfectly and looks great!
"on March 29, 2017",My only complaint is that the screen protector does not fit.

"on February 5, 2017",It's pretty good :) has popped off on its own once though.
"on September 25, 2017",Nice quality and a great value but color get dirty easily.
"on December 8, 2017",Beautiful color
"on August 20, 2017",I really like this case. It fits perfectly on my laptop.
"on October 31, 2016","The product overall is very good and it has a good value for money.The cover is very good and fits perfectly the MacBook Air 13 inches. I have read too many reviews complaining about bad fit for different computers... to everyone who is buying this, PLEASE make sure that you get the cover that is for the right model of YOUR computer. Do not just read the name of the computer, verify the model. I really thank Mosiso for the good advise on this.The keyboard cover is good as well, it fits the keyboard very well. The only drawback (which is not specific of this product) is that sound in this computer gets dimmed when you use the silicone keyboard cover, so my son has to take the keyboard cover when he wants to listen to music or watch a movie without the headset if he wants to have good quality of sound.The screen protector is really not worth it. It is plastic screen protector, impossible to attach to the screen without bubbles... Do not even bother to try to get it installed. Anyway, just for the cover and keyboard protector the product is worth it. Just lower your expectations regarding the screen protector and definitely do not make it your purchasing decision factor."
"on March 12, 2017","Nice hard case, though I'm not using the keyboard cover. doesn't seem to want to stay on."
"on March 27, 2017",Product fits my mac well. Love the color.
"on July 5, 2017",Excellent.  Cover for well!
"on January 22, 2018",I love the cover and it protects my computer very well.
"on December 16, 2017",This was a great purchase for protection on my MacBook!
"on October 26, 2017","Great product, no issues, fit perfectly on the laptop."
"on September 7, 2017",just bought it. covers everything well. The keyboard cover is great as well.
"on December 20, 2016",the bottom of the case breaks easily but is very pretty on the laptop
"on January 29, 2017","Beautiful color and went on so easily, looks amazing and STAYS ON AND hugs the computer crisply!"
"on December 19, 2017",Loved it at first but it cracked after one month.
"on December 30, 2017",my daughter really loved her new case. Thank you.
"on January 21, 2017",Just as advertised and came promptly. Great value
"on October 31, 2016",the case is a fingerprint magnet but you will get used to it
"on October 25, 2017",Fits perfectly with my Mac! Great quality for the price.
"on November 7, 2016",Love it for the price. great color. does get dirty really fast though
"on January 7, 2018",This was perfect for my husband's mac air book.
"on September 22, 2017",Good for the price!
"on November 2, 2016","The laptop cover is great! The keyboard cover, however, does muffle the sound a bit so I don't use that but otherwise everything is great!"
"on March 25, 2017","No instructions at all.  That was pretty annoying since I put the top on backwards (rotated 180) and now it is impossible to get it off. Watched YouTube videos and guess I'll have to find some hard plastic pieces to jar into sides...  Seems like might be fine, but the little tabs on side don't line up now since I did it wrong. Instructions would have helped.  And not a big deal since I didn't even plan on getting screen cover, but screen cover is impossible!  Must have to be trained to put these things on.  Had huuuge bubbles and couldn't get it to line up perfectly.  Gave up and threw away. Rated a 4 since I love the color (matches my mosiso bag perfectly) and has a soft feel.  Seems it's sitting well despite the fact I put it on wrong.  Nervous to try more to take off since others report breaking it. So, guess I'll have this forever with my computer!"
"on December 27, 2017",Beautiful case and I like it ..
"on January 11, 2018",Cover is good but color was not as pictured

"on February 6, 2017",I am very satisfied and pleased with it.
"on August 1, 2017",I love my laptop case!!! Easy to put on and very cute!
"on August 22, 2016","I am pleased with my computer cover. Now I don't feel like every time I touch it that I'm going to scratch or leave fingerprints. It was easy to put on--you just click it in several places. Of course, you need a PhD to put on a screen protector so mine has a lot of bumps in it, but it's still hard to tell that it is on. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is that you cannot see the apple logo while the computer is off/shut."

"on January 25, 2017","UPDATED REVIEW (Feb. 3rd, 2017): I had no issue with contacting the company and receiving the missing items. I was actually VERY relieved to deal with customer service that was actually nice. They quickly shipped my keyboard cover and screen protector and I received it a few days after asking. That being said I have updated the amount of stars on this product review. (I had 4 stars before... now it's 5 stars.) I have used the keyboard cover and the case for a few days now and I absolutely love using both of them however I HAVE replaced my case for a new one... For some reason the case is a magnet for anything you don't want to stick to it but I've learned that most rubberized cases do that so I definitely do NOT blame the company for this because it's my OCD flaring up anyway. I still use the keyboard cover because I'm starting to fall in love with the wine red color more than I planned. Thank you Mosiso for providing great products and wonderful customer service. It's truly appreciated.Old review: The case is perfect... it fit my computer just fine (better than my Kuzy case that I spent $30 on) however I didn't receive the screen protector OR the keyboard cover. Im not exactly heartbroken over the screen protector but the keyboard cover was one of the main reasons why I ordered THIS combo so I'm pretty annoyed/upset with that.Just in case anyone is wondering... the logo DOES shine still and there isn't a cut out for it like some other cases have.I will be contacting the company/Amazon today about receiving what I paid for or returning the case for a refund. I will update this review afterwards."
"on November 4, 2016",Arrived quickly. Fits perfectly on my MacBook Air!
"on December 12, 2016","It's very nice, and does the job well."
"on December 30, 2016",It was hard to attach but fits just fine!
"on February 22, 2017","Fits perfect , looks cute"
"on February 25, 2017",It's a great case
"on October 2, 2016",love the screen protector that comes with it
"on September 24, 2016","I purchased this case for my brand new MacBook Air 13-inch computer. The rose gold color is beautiful. It's a little tricky to get off once it's on and you may need some YouTube video assistance to remove it. If you're wondering about how the rose gold keyboard protector matches, don't worry, it's a great match. Very nice looking. The keyboard letters/symbols are very slightly off but not terrible. The view of the color of the case and keyboard protector as shown online is deceiving. It is more beautiful than it appears. It picks up scratches easily but better the cover than the computer. My original order arrived with small scratches on the top cover and after reaching out to the company I was sent a replacement top cover. Unfortunately the replacement was a slightly lighter rose gold than the first one and didn't quite match the original bottom piece. The company then very graciously sent me a complete top/bottom set to replace the original which match each other perfectly (although slightly lighter than the first set I received). The case stays on well and I get a lot of compliments on the color. The apple logo shows through when the computer is on as a very pretty shimmery pink.  I am very happy with the case and the customer service I received. If you are considering getting this case, I would highly recommend it."
"on October 30, 2016","I wish I could give this a 4.5, but only a 4 or 5 is available, so I guess I have to go with 4 even though I feel it is too low. I ordered the mint green case, and I pleased with what I received. The keyboard cover is perfect: the color is great, and it fits perfectly! I got an extra keyboard cover, too, so I received a mint one and a green one. I did not expect this, but I like that I have a replacement just in case something happens. The actual hard case is definitely not as full of a color as the picture shows. It is way more transparent, but it is still pretty. The color is not a huge deal anyway. The snaps on the case work well, and it fits fine. It even came with extra feet for the bottom piece, which is great. All of the ports are fully uncovered, and there is no functionality lost with the case. The laptop still opens fully and is not bothered by the case. I have only had the case for a few days, so I'm not really sure about long-term wear. However, for such a cheap price, I would not be bothered even if it did break in a few months."
"on July 25, 2017","I like the exterior case. The color is nice and it will help protect my computer from bumps and scratches. The screen protector has bubbles in it and I may end up removing it. I did not end up liking the keyboard cover, I did not like the way typing felt with it on. It's a nice thing to include in the purchase, but I don't think I'll be using it unless I'm using my computer while eating some greasy pizza or something."
"on September 21, 2016","The cover is very cute and easy to put on and remove if needed. However, I've had problems with the keyboard cover. It's very minor, the writing on the keyboard is not exactly where the - illuminated - writing of the actual computer is, which means in the dark it's kind of like you have double vision when you're looking down.This by itself wouldn't bug me enough to give it only 4 stars. The reason why I couldn't give 5 was the cover on the screen. It had 3 layers, and it was impossibly hard to apply. It came out all wrinkly - and I did and redid it about 5 times - with the help of my husband.Very disappointed, I ended up just tossing the thing.Other than that, great little package - what you would expect for the price. I'd purchase again."
"on December 11, 2016","The keyboard cover protects my macbook from crumbs and other junk.  The case is pretty.  I got it to keep the top from getting scratched up, so only used the top portion.  I didn't use the screen protector either because they are a pain to apply."
"on October 27, 2016","With this product, you get what you pay for. The bottom piece is a tad loose, but nothing too major. The keyboard cover also seems to a little loose as well. Overall in the package, you are recieving 3 pieces for under $20 which is not bad ALL! It arrived a day early and was packaged nicely. Nothing came chipped or broken."
"on February 14, 2017",I BOUGHT IT AND STILL HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT.. BUT IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
"on June 9, 2017","To be honest, I found this bundle while shopping for just a rose-gold laptop hard case.  The fact that it came in a bundle with screen and keyboard protectors was just a nice bonus.  The case itself is beautiful and is a true rose-gold!  For color comparison, it's almost the exact same shade of rose-gold as my iPhone 7.  It even has a nice shimmer to it, which was an unexpected [girly] bonus!  It's very opaque, so if you're hoping to be able to see stickers or decals through it, that's not going to happen.  The Apple logo can be seen only when it's lit up, otherwise you wouldn't even know it was there.  This case was pretty hard to click into place, which was frustrating in the moment.  But now that it's on there, it's hard to imagine that anything will be able to make it come off.  The fit is VERY snug.  I'm completely happy with this case and would buy it again in a heartbeat!So why only 4 stars?  Well, the screen protector that came in the bundle was a lesson in frustration.  It's wasn't a precise fit and left a just-wide-enough-to-drive-you-crazy gap across the top of the screen.  Also, despite my best efforts, I was unable to completely eliminate all the air bubbles out from under it.  It's now in the trash. In addition to that, the keyboard protector is making me cross-eyed!  All of the letters are slightly off, so when you lay them over the illuminated keys, it gives the illusion that they're blurry.  Several of the images on the ""F"" key row across the top and even the power button are completely different, too, making me think that this keyboard cover isn't really meant for a MacBook Air as advertised.  As a keyboard cover, it gets the job done, and the color is a perfect match to the case.  But I'm really not sure I'm going to be able to keep using it - it's just too hard to look at the keys!If you're in the market for a true rose-gold laptop case for a MacBook Air, then this case will definitely make a great impression!  And once your aching fingers recover from the installation process, you'll really appreciate the protection that's offered with the snug fit.  Lower your expectations for the other pieces of the bundle, however, because the screen and keyboard covers leave a lot to be desired."
"on August 15, 2017","For what I wanted (cheap yet passable) this product fits the bill.The case is hard plastic on the inner side, although it does have some flex to it. The outer surface is coated with a slight rubberized material. After only 20 minutes of ownership, from simply sliding the case in and out of my leather sleeve there is a tiny bit on the bottom where the rubberized coating has started to flake off; I am certain it will spread out and the coating will continue to rub off. While the surface feels slightly gritty, the rubberized coating still feels very nice. Be aware, the coating attracts fingerprints and can be difficult to clean.The rubber feet are also starting to flake off in very thin layers. As an extra set of rubber feet are included, I am not concerned.I purchased the ‚Äúmarsala red‚Äù option. The color looks primarily like is shown in the product image; a deep dark red. Depending on the lighting there is however a slight pinkish tone to the color. I am happy with the color regardless.The case snaps on easily (for the top lid, the two tabs snap onto the top up by the webcam, and the tree tabs snap down at the bottom by the hinges.) The case adds a small amount of weight, but it‚Äôs enough weight that if you close your MacBook halfway the extra weight will slowly force the lid down and the Mac will close on it‚Äôs own.The keyboard cover is nice, although there are a few things to be aware of. The MacBook‚Äôs speakers are underneath the keyboard so this cover muffles the sound noticeably. The volume is still acceptable, although the sound is missing the crispness and instead sounds a bit dull. The backlight barely shines through the keys (even at full brightness) but you can still clearly see the outline around the keys shine through. For the OCDs, the caps lock key does not line up exactly with the indicator light. With the exception of the power button (which shows an eject symbol that my MacBook Air does not have) and space bar (which has ‚Äúmosiso‚Äù printed on it) all the function symbols match exactly how the built-in keys show. The entire cover fits nicely into the rectangular cutout edging around the keyboard.The other reviews are correct - the screen protector is just a hair too small. It doesn‚Äôt bother me but would drive an OCD-er crazy. There is a tiny applicator card included; throw it away and use something else a little thinner and stiffer. The included cleaning cloth is rough and thin, like medical gauze. It is not like a microfiber cloth that you would use to clean eyeglasses.Overall, the price is just right for what you receive. I don‚Äôt expect this case to last a full year, but I do feel confident it should last several months at least. I‚Äôm happy with it."
"on November 27, 2017","I read a number of reviews prior to purchasing, but decided to buy it anyway despite the negative reviews. I was tempted to rate it 5 stars, as opposed to 4, simply due to the price point, but there are some legitimate ‚Äúissues‚Äù.Pros:-It‚Äôs hard to complain about anything considering the product only cost $14 and the fact that it includes a hard case, silicone keyboard cover, and a screen protector.-The case fits well, but one of the corner clips seems to pop off every now and then (mainly when the screen is flipped open further than 110-135 degrees.-The silicone keyboard cover is great! It fits well, doesn‚Äôt slide around, an has a minimal effect on the keys backlight function.-The front cover blocks the Apple logo while the device is powered off, but allows it to shine through when powered on. The effect is sort of like looking at a glowing apple symbol on a foggy night, which I think looks nice.Cons:-The plastic definitly seems somewhat brittle and as though it would likely crack if subjected to any real impact. That being said, it‚Äôs for scratch protection and NOT impact protection. I would not recommend taking it off very often, as the side tabs may eventually break.-The color (I order wine red), is very different than what is pictured or what I would consider to be wine red. It‚Äôs closer to a purple/burgundy, and much more dull than pictured.-The screen protector is terrible... I will probably remove it and throw it away. It‚Äôs made from poor quality material and is noticeable smaller than the screen. That being said, it‚Äôs not really necessary considering it‚Äôs not a touch screen.-There are ventilation slits along the entire bottom despite there being no ventilation mechanism there. That will just allow dirt/dust to enter the case, possibly scratching the device over time. That, coupled with the brittle plastic, will likely be problematic as continuous removal for cleaning will likely lead to broken case tabs...All things considered, if you are looking for a cheap product to prevent your shiny new MacBook Air from getting scratched, and would like a keyboard cover to go along with it, this is a GREAT buy. However, if you just dropped around $1,000 on a new laptop and don‚Äôt mind spending another $32 (as opposed to $14) you should purchase a Speck case ($25) and what ever keyboard cover you‚Äôd like (they sell for $7 on Amazon), as it‚Äôs a better quality case and will probably outlast this one."
"on December 29, 2017","I got the white Mosiso Plastic Hard Case (and keyboard cover, screen protector) for my new MacBook Air. The white was less transparent than I expected, but I do like it. I will have to wait and see how the wear and tear goes. I had a hard time finding a white case for some reason? but this one will work. It snapped on and fit well. The screen cover I was expecting to try out and throw away, but it's actually not bad. I can't even notice it on my screen. When I was searching for this case, I wanted to see user photos of the white but couldn't find many so I decided to upload some. So far so good, but keep in mind I'll need to give it a few weeks to see if it gets dirty or cracks easily. Keyboard cover is my first one, so not sure what to expect but so far it feels nice and isn't bothersome (another add-on I imagined I'd try and throw away). Surprised! Just wish the white was a little more see-thru."
"on December 23, 2017","I would like to say that this product is worth the money spent. I have been using this case for over a month now. I love the color and feel of it. Looks as good as it was on day1. However there are some features that has room for improvement.Pros:1) Aesthetically it looks very pretty (I have the rose gold color which is a matte finished rose gold, not the shiny type one). Love the feel of the case. Very smooth but sturdy enough. Does not look like cheap plastic.2) Product packaging was great and came on time.3) No instructions included with package but they have images on their Amazon product page that briefly shows how to assemble the case which is pretty straightforward.4) For those that care about the apple logo,  it is visible when you have the laptop open.5) Came with the screen and keyboard protector (which is pretty smooth to touch as well).Cons:1) The keyboard protector does not snap in place. It has quite a bit of room for wiggle which means dirt and dust can easily go underneath it. (see picture). I have tried to rub on the edges of the keyboard protector to hold it in place but that has not helped in sealing the edges completely.2) The screen protector was very hard to get on the screen; irrespective of cleaning the screen several times before hand and being super patient in slowly transferring the protector to the screen I have several bubbles on the screen. It would be awesome if they can come up with a hassle free way to transfer the screen protector.In summary, like I had mentioned before this product is worth the money spent. I would definitely try other products/cases from the manufacturer in the future."
"on November 12, 2017","I love the case; it arrived quickly, was exactly the color as the photos, and has held up very well. The bottom part is a bit small, for some reason, even though the lid fits perfectly; it isn't so small as it falls off or doesn't fit, but it doesn't hook around the back all the way like it should. It hasn't been an issue, though.The keyboard protector, not so much love. It was easy to apply, but made it a pain to type anything because I had to press it twice as hard, and ripped after a week. To be honest, even if it hadn't ripped, I would have taken it off because it made it so difficult to type. The screen protector was impossible to apply, which was a bummer, but I appreciate that it came with the case, and maybe someone else will have better luck."
"on May 24, 2017","I chose this based on the number of positive reviews and I'm glad I did because it fits like a glove on my Mac Air. I'm just really disappointed with the color. I chose the Rose Gold to match my iPhone but once I opened it, it's not really Rose Gold! It's more of like Dark Metallic Pink or Metallic Mauve! I should have read all the reviews but with over 2000 reviews, who has time for that? Because it's dark, the logo is not that visible when in use and completely not visible when not in use which is fine with me. It's the dark pink shade that bothers me. If you like Dark Metallic Pink, this is for you.As for the keyboard, I love it. It's so nice to touch. The shade is like Mauve so I'm good with it.With the screen protector, I didn't put it on. It adds too much reflection that I know will bother me and I'm worried it might be either hard to take off or would leave a mark.Overall, I would recommend this. Just pick the color that you won't regret."
"on October 12, 2017","Using just the top cover on my retina MBP -- I took the bottom off for several reasons:  it made the overall package too thick;  the rubber pads didn't grip as well as the ones on my MBP;  and (most importantly) I believe that covering the bottom of the machine does not let the metal bottom work as effectively as a heat sink for the MBP.  I was getting more fan intervention, and at higher RPMs.  I checked the CPU temps and they were about 5-8 degrees C hotter than with the cover off.  Using just the top provides all the protection that I need and want, and does not compromise the cooling."
"on November 3, 2017","I've had this case on my laptop for a little over a month now. The color is very accurate to what you see. The screen cover was a little difficult to get on, but has stuck well. The keyboard cover takes some getting used to, but does it's job and adds a splash of color to your keys as well. As for the outer shell itself, it's just okay. I've already had one of the prongs that keeps the bottom on break. The stickers that are used as cushions in the corners of the case on the bottom frequently move, and one has come off completely. They provide extras though. All in all, decent case for the price. I'd recommend giving your laptop a good cleaning before putting the case on so you don't need to remove it often or ever."
"on October 7, 2017","I love the matte feeling of this case and the color is beautiful. I only subtracted one star (I wish I could subtract a half a star) because one corner of the case does not fit as snug as the other corners do. There is probably a 1/16 of an inch (if not less) gap between one corner and the laptop. However, it does not compromise the protection. The case is not lose in any way. It still fits tight to the computer. I didn‚Äôt have to work with customer service, but they did send me an email to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. I would purchase a product from this company again."
"on December 6, 2017","GREAT PROTECTION FOR MY MACBOOK AIR!I have had this on for about 3 months and have had 0 problems with my macbook maintining its new look. I can tell that my macbook would have tons of scratches based on the scratches that are on the case.In addition it comes with a keyboard cover which comes in handy for sticky fingers.Only downside about it, the keyboard cover somewhat muffles the sounds coming out of the laptop. You can hear the difference when playing music or watching videos with sound."
"on November 25, 2017","I'm pleased with my purchase.  The ""gold"" color is more of a true rose gold, which is actually what I was looking for, rather than the overly pink version that the ""rose gold"" color the manufacturer offers appears to be.  The case was easy enough to snap on, but the key protector, while attractive, keeps falling off.  I don't know how long I'll leave it on, to be honest, before I get fed up and throw it into a drawer to be forgotten.  I gave up on the screen protector.  It got some fuzz on it during application and I couldn't get it off.  I just gave up and threw it away.  While I can't speak to durability yet (I just got it today), if I have issues, I'll update my review."
"on August 11, 2017","I got the black one and it's good. The case is not as snug as I would have liked.  When I open/close my laptop, there are times that a side would snap off.  But the case definitely won't fall off since you would need to pull off at least 3 sides to get it off.  I was able to apply the screen protector well, no bubbles or loose ends. The keyboard cover is  ok.  I prefer the feel of the keyboard without it but I can work with it too. The keyboard cover does cover the light of the keys at night. Overall, for the price, I think it's a good buy."
"on December 5, 2017","The color is great, the keyboard cover is my favorite. It's soft and fits just right. I thought the hard case for the front would've been a little more transparent to see the apple logo when the light isn't lit while using, but it isn't, which to me was disappointing, so unless your Macbook is open and in use, the apple logo isn't visible. The case itself fit's like it should. It has a soft texture to it. I haven't had a problem with how it fits. It snaps on okay. The screen protector is okay... all it came with was a cloth- no tool to press the air bubbles out or an alcohol pad to prep the screen before hand, so there is a few air bubbles that I can't seem to get rid of (which is truly annoying if you're someone like me who likes a clean screen). Good enough if you're looking for something cheap/temporary as a protectant case package deal. You get what you pay for. Not completely bad though!"
"on July 15, 2017","For the price, you get a pretty good deal. This order comes with a hard case, a keyboard cover, and a screen protector. The screen protector is pretty bad, to be honest. It doesn't even cover my entire screen. That being said, I don't mind that much. While it may not cover my entire screen, it still makes it easier to wipe off fingerprints and the like. The hard case has gone through a lot in my hands. On multiple occasions I have forgotten my computer was in my backpack and dropped my backpack on the floor. So far, no cracks or dents to my computer! Unfortunately, after 6 months of use, the case is cracked in multiple places and the tabs that hold it onto the computer are slowly falling off. The keyboard cover is what I purchased this for, and it has yet to let me down. It's incredibly durable. I have some complaints about effects to sound quality and it's a little harder to type, but overall this entire package is worth your money."
"on November 22, 2016","The color was as expected, I love it!  The keyboard cover is great as well, fits and is accurate and does a great job keeping my keys clean and adds some nice pizzaz.  The cover itself is what gets the 4 star instead of the 5.  The bottom piece (covering the body, not the screen) isn't quite as snug as I would like.  Sometimes, the two front snaps (closest to the track pad) pop off just slightly.  It has never come off completely, or even close really, but the little tab doesn't always stay put.  Always snaps back to place with ease.  My laptop is very mobile with me, so while I would prefer a tighter fit, it is not loose enough that it is a nuisance or a concern.  I would still purchase Mosiso again, but anyone more particular than I might want to be aware of this."
"on August 30, 2017","I really like this case.  It seems much more durable than the one I bought from Apple.  I really like the keyboard cover which matches the outside cover!  Pretty cool.  However, the screen protector just doesn't stay on.  They really need a better system than the little ""sticky"" tabs.  I finally removed it because it kept coming off every time I opened the computer.  Otherwise, it would have gotten 5 stars.  Even my husband, who hates any kind of cover, is looking at it too."
"on September 16, 2017","I love this case! Looks beautiful! Came with a mark on the keyboard cover and the top shell, but they are hardly noticeable so I don't mind. Took a bit to get it to fit on the laptop, but it feels sturdy. I love that it came with extra feet stickers for the bottom case. Gorgeous color."
"on November 26, 2017","The color is my favorite part of this product, it‚Äôs a beautiful tan/pink. The case is sturdy and is soft to the touch and doesn‚Äôt show finger marks. Four stars only because the keyboard cover had mold all on the backside of it, I could easily clean it but that shouldn‚Äôt happen that‚Äôs gross. Oh and I love the screen protector too"
"on March 14, 2017","This case is great. It fit's my MacBook Air perfectly Very easy to pop on and stays on. The keyboard cover is great also. Fits the keys exact and gives them a soft touch feel and also quiets the key clicks. The only problem I had was with the screen guard. I consider myself a pro at putting on screen guards. I've installed them on my iPhone's, iPad's, family and friends phones and tablets. This one, no matter how I worked it on had bubbles, little tiny bubbles. My OCD finally caused me to just peel it off because it bothered me."
"on December 29, 2017","Does its job with protecting the laptop and glad to have bought. The screen protector was a little difficult to apply evenly but otherwise good product and glad to have bought it. I don't think I'll be keeping the keypad on as it's not the best fit, besides that it would still be capable to protect the keyboard. I just prefer the regular keypad and not the application I received, everything arrived just as described."
"on December 27, 2017","I ordered this product in mint green and love how it looks on my Mac. It's pretty easy to put on and feels so smooth. The Apple logo shines through pretty well just as it states in the description. So far it's done a pretty good job of protecting my MacBook, so I'm happy.Some things to keep in mind however, it does feel slightly heavier with the case on, however it's not too noticeable. Additionally a few of the keys on my keyboard cover appeared wrinkled, but that's not a deal breaker for me as I mainly bought this for the case rather than the keyboard cover and screen protector.Overall would recommend to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, simple, and aesthetically pleasing protection for their MacBook."
"on November 18, 2017","The case is great.  The keyboard cover stinks.  When I placed it over my keys, I had to then push much harder than I do on the bare keys.  I tried it for about a week hoping I would get used to it, but finally took it off.  If you are wanting a great cover, this would be a good purchase.  I you are buying it for the keyboard cover, I would suggest you keep on looking."
"on July 30, 2017","Exactly what I wanted and very reasonably priced! The screen protector is a tiny bit small on one edge of my 13"" Air, but I understand it can't be perfectly sized or the air bubbles would never escape. The keyboard cover fits snugly, and the hard cover seems durable and clipped on easily. The rubber feet on the bottom of the cover do stick out a little bit, and the top piece is not very transparent in the rose gold color, but otherwise I'm pleased with the purchase!"
"on August 15, 2017","I really like this case. I put a decal on my laptop first & then co reed it with the clear case, it look amazing. I have the MacBook Air & the bottom piece of this case doesn't fit as tight as the top. Also, there is one area that looks smidged, but you can't really see it."
"on January 17, 2017",The product is as described. I really love it but there is two things that I don't like. The cover gets dirty really quick and the keyboard cover has like a white podwer that feels weird but other than that Is good quality. See pictures.
"on January 21, 2017","I ordered the Mosiso Metalic Coated Plastic hard case with screen protector and keyboard cover and so far, it's been exactly what it's advertised to be. I absolutely love the color! The only issues I have are the keyboard covers markings are not an exact match for the key locations on the keyboard (just slightly off, enough to notice), which isn't really an issue and the addition of the case has increased the weight of my MacBook Air. Again, not really an issue but things that stood out to me. Otherwise, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this product if anyone is looking for a hard case cover, etc."
"on October 28, 2017",I needed an easy case to snap on my mac since my kids have been using it for homework. Love that it was easy to pop on and had the keyboard cover also.
"on October 21, 2016","Recieved today. Packaged very nicely. First impression of the case was that it looked amazing on my macbook air! Case seems like it will prodect against dings and scratches but obviously wont protect against any drops (was'nt expecting it to). Tha apple logo is see through the case and the case has a smooth texture to it. Also, the bonus screen protector (which i dont plan on using) and the keyboard protector which you can hardly tell is there are nice. We'll see how it does with color fading later on. Will update review when i find any flaws."
"on August 12, 2017","So far, so good. I bought this primarily for the keyboard cover, and sadly, that's my least favorite part. :( It's odd typing on the silicone because you have to press harder. Still, I can get used to it and it's good protection for my keyboard.I love the color of this case and it went on so easily. Granted, my laptop is generally used at home on a desk, so it won't get wear and tear, so I can't speak for how durable the cover is. I do like the feet because my MacBook had plastic feet on the bottom that made it slide all around on my desk, and now it sits nicely on the non-slip rubber feet. The cover doesn't impede my typing at all and it's not in the way. I love the super low profile and the perfect fit. Plus, red is my favorite color and the apple shines through so nicely.The screen saver went on fine except that my cat wouldn't leave me alone so cat hair is trapped behind it. That's not the seller's fault so I won't complain. :D It went on easily so that's a plus."
"on November 5, 2017","Its pretty good for a case, though it does not provide any shock protection like a phone case would, but it is better than nothing. Then again you should not be dropping your macbook in the first place anyway. But it fits well and is a good alternative to cover in stickers rather than the actual computer, the apple logo is covered up by the case but it is transparent enough that the logo shines through even on the dark maroon color. If you're a bull in a china shop like I am the bottom part of the case may crack a little bit if you take it on and off a lot, but other than that I am very satisfied with the result."
"on October 23, 2017","does its job. top case was a bit hard to put on seeing as one clip wouldn't adjust properly but take the time to do it and it fits fine. stickers on the keyboard cover are a bit off but nothing drastic, it does interfere with the speakers sound obviously but again nothing drastic. the screen protector is great, takes a while to clear any bubbles but its a nice fit. other than that the color is true to the images provided, i got airy blue and its beautiful. been about a week since my purchase and so far its doing a great job at protecting my laptop. satisfied with the price."
"on September 10, 2017","Case fits perfectly & is very cute. Only complaint is that the letters and numbers on the rubber keyboard cover does not line up with the actual keys, so sometimes the backlight shines through & makes the letters look funny since they don't perfectly line up. Other than that, it's great. Love that it comes with a screen protector!!"
"on March 23, 2017","Great product, fits my laptop perfectly.  Bought this along with the Tomtoc 360 Protective Laptop Sleeve and it fits it perfectly!!.  The only thing that I don't like as much is the protector for the keyboard.  I feel like it needs some getting used to.  When typing, the fingers tend to stick on the keyboard protector so the transition from keys to keys isn't as smooth as it would be without the protector.  Other than that minor issue everything else is perfect!!"
"on September 18, 2017",It works really well and it looks great. It's a soft thick type of material. I was disappointed that the keyboard doesn't glow as much with the cover on and it doesn't glow the maroon color but besides that it works just fineI did NOT apply the plastic screen protector because I order a tempered glass. So I do not know how well the screen protector works but I did receive it undamaged and it looks as if it would work perfectly correctly.
"on August 28, 2017","Great case, my third. But I ordered the rose quartz and I got a pale pink. So definitely not the color as advertised. But still really pretty!"
"on September 19, 2017","Loved the case and keyboard cover, beautiful color and finish, and very lightweight fit is almost perfect (just a little bit big on the front bottom corners) but otherwise keeps still. I do not give it a 5 star rating because my package did not include the screen cover promised to me on the offer."
"on July 8, 2017","I got the clear case, which does its job but is extremely shiny! It looks sort of like my computer is wrapped in plastic. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but if you want something more matte I would get a different color. Other than that, it fits very well and the keyboard cover fits very well (didn't use the screen protector bc air bubbles)"
"on August 12, 2017","I threw out the keyboard cover (couldn't get used to it) and the screen protector (couldn't get the damn bubbles out).  But the case is great.  It's light, was easy to get on, and looks and feels great!  Perfect added protection with no sacrifice.  And I like how the apple is visible through the color I chose (serenity blue). :)"
"on October 24, 2017","It came in very quickly! The color is just like the picture! It doesn't snap on some ends of my computer, but it doesn't fall off or budge so i guess I will live with it. It's also very hard to clean if something gets smudged on it. I am overall satisfied because the price was cheap for everything that was included and seems like good quality! I will probably buy more from this seller for sure."
"on January 21, 2017",Great fitting case for macbook air.  Seems sturdy and has a good key cover.  They could do a little better job with the screen protector as far as instructions on how to apply or some simple tools to help you correctly apply it as most screen covers have today. Without alcohol wipes/spray/guiding stickers/or bubble remover I ended up with some dust and bubbles trapped.  But overall four stars.
"on February 2, 2017","Love this product! It gives the MacBook a very sleek and stylish look. Check the model of your MacBook and make sure the cover you order is the right one, based on your Mac model. It is a perfect fit when you order by the Mac model no. Extremely happy with the color as it is true to what's shown. The only con is the keyboard cover shifts easily, but I'm pleased with everything else."
"on July 28, 2017",Nice to protect macbook from scratches. Not the worst and not the absolute best.  Looks nice and feels nice matte light pink finish. Keyboard cover matches and is very useful! Love it thank you !
"on April 7, 2017","I absolutely love the color! The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the keyboard cover. My MacBook Air has the French keyboard, so the enter key has a different shape and there are extra keys. But it will do."
"on December 29, 2017","I bought this for my niece as her old case was quite worn out. She seemed very pleased with it, and liked the color a lot."
"on September 3, 2017","I really loved the clear view and tight, secure clasp on my Mac. Unfortunately, the latch was a little too tight and when I tried to get it off to clean the inside it snapped and cracked at the bottom. I was disappointed at how difficult it was to get off and how easily it cracked. It was my fault though since I was a little too impatient."
"on February 10, 2017","It's cute and comes with a keyboard case as well as a screen protector. However, it lost a star because the top doesn't seem like a perfect fit. The case is VERY tight and it was extremely hard to take off. The reason I say it's not a perfect fit is because when I open my laptop, the case kind of lifts off a bit. Nothing extreme but can get a little annoying. I like it though and I'll keep it!"
"on March 14, 2017","My review on the Mosiso Plastic hard case.Plastic Hard Case:This case itself is plastic on the inside and a smooth texture on the outside. It easily attaches onto the laptop and could easily be removed. The case covers the corners for protection against a fall but the case easily does get fingerprint/smudges.Keyboard cover:The keyboard is a rubber thin cover that goes over the original keyboard. The keyboard with the cover could feel a little unconformable on the first use, but once you continue using it you will feel a difference. When typing the clicking isn't as loud as on the original keyboard and for the Marsala red the LED light isn't as bright as it is without the cover.Screen Protector:The screen protector is a great clear screen protector. When installing, bubbles could be left over since it isn't such an easy task to accomplish. The screen protector covers the screen with a little bit uncovered but really should not be a huge problem.Overall, for the price and what it comes with this will really satisfy your needs."
"on February 4, 2018","I have had this case on my Mac for a little over a year now. A corner chipped off a little, but otherwise the case itself is fine. Some of the paint on the keyboard cover has rubbed off around the spacebar area, but nothing major. Has held up very well."
"on October 16, 2017","This laptop case is as expected for the price. The bottom of the laptop case does not fit on completely perfectly, leaving a small crack between the laptop and the case where the mousepad is. The keyboard cover remains on nicely, but the letters printed on the cover do not match up well with the letters on the keys, which is not a very good aesthetic. It is also so rubbery that it is more difficult to type, so sometimes I take it off to type. The color (rose quartz) was exactly how it was depicted, which was greatly appreciated. Overall, this laptop case gets the job done and has beautiful colors for a cheap price. Some complaints, but I would buy it again due to convenience and price."
"on January 30, 2018","It's beautiful when you first receive it. But the case easily gets scratched up and the glitter underside rubs off very easily. The keyboard also is starting to rub off. However, ‚Äãfor the price point, it is not bad at all."
"on October 17, 2017","While the cover fits perfectly the Apple Macbook, the two of the white rubber feets  always falls off. Once I found it inside my bag and able to stick it back. I wish they designed it better for snug-fit."
"on April 3, 2017","Like the hardshell cover, but keyboard cover make it impossible 2 read in the dark, but I like it anyway just have to remove when using in hospital"
"on December 4, 2017","The case itself is really nice and sleek, true to it's color- oil residue from your fingers will leave finger prints but that's easily to wipe off. The keyboard cover is very cute and fits perfectly, it's actually really comfy. The only thing I don't like about the keyboard cover is that over time the pink color on the cover fades away, and some of my letters is already missing it's color- it started to wear down pretty fast, it'll probably last for a few more months than I'll have to remove it since it'll look like it's 'dirty'. Screen protector fits nicely, but make sure after you place it on, don't take it off even if it looks imperfect, because this causes more air bubbles."
"on August 24, 2017","Pretty nice, does the job, but it does look a little cheap"
"on November 1, 2017","I love this case, it's very soft yet protective.The only inconvenient that I found was that thekeyboard of my laptop is ""extended"", but there wasn't an option to choose that instead of the regular one."
"on September 3, 2017","Its a great case, but not my color. Color is the same in person, just chose the wrong color. Still a very nice case"
"on October 2, 2016","The case is great, but the keyboard cover is not at all the nice color of the case.The only reason for the 4 is because of the keyboard cover."
"on December 18, 2016","I really enjoy the case, but the keyboard cover isn't really great quality. It's not smooth completely on some keys so it doesn't lay properly - kind of like the material is shriveled up on some parts. But I use the case and it's perfect!"
"on August 18, 2017",It's cute but it makes my laptop heavier. It's heaviness makes the screen fall back. I'm gonna keep it on but I just wish it was more lightweight. Came with screen protector and arrived pretty fast as well. Love the rose gold color! :-)
"on October 2, 2017","Great case! The keyboard pad won‚Äôt stick on my keys, though."
"on October 31, 2017",It‚Äôs very pretty the only thing wrong is that my bottom edges won‚Äôt completely press down where the two pieces meet plus it‚Äôs extremely hard to take off.
"on August 6, 2017",Fit really well.  The keyboard section didn't fit perfectly but it is pretty good.  Daughter love the color.
"on August 25, 2017",Great case. Keyboard cover did not fit at all. Still well worth buying!
"on October 27, 2017","I love this case, the way it feels, and it fits my laptop perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is now that when I play music on my laptop, it makes it sound a little bit muffled."
"on August 20, 2016","Very good case, easy use. Got it dirty the first 20 minutes I got it out and I can't clean it off with any cleaners its small stain that can't really been seen, but I like it other than I can't clean a stain off."
"on May 13, 2017","This came pretty fast and I'm impressed. The case went on smoothly and quickly. The sticky cover for the keys is hard to type on, but you get used to it after a while."
"on July 21, 2017",Seems like a good case. Very inexpensive. Not sure I'm going to keep the silicone keyboard on because it seems to move around. Wish it came with instructions for how to put it on
"on September 21, 2017",Perfect fit for the outer case. The keyboard cover gets a little wonky at times but it's better than nothing. And I LOVE the turquoise color. :)
"on March 6, 2017",Easy to attach and seems sturdy. So glad to have extra set of rubber feet included as that was a previous issue on my old case.
"on August 2, 2017",Great case!
"on December 9, 2017",Very fast delivery! Haven't used the cover yet since it is a gift. It looks just like advertised.
"on September 1, 2017",Hi.. the case is nice but I got it about a week ago and one of the corners already cracked and fell off randomly
"on December 7, 2016",It protects exterior of my MacBook as well as the keyboard & screen. Thinking about buying another design as well.
"on April 15, 2017",Love the case except the top cover is to heavy and pulls my screen back.
"on December 3, 2017",It was a very sturdy product and it did not take a long time to arrive. I had no problems with the product
"on November 8, 2017",the colors is exactly what it looks like. It's clean and I love it so much! Would def recommend!
"on October 8, 2017",Love everything about it. Came super quick to my destination
"on December 27, 2017","Great product, it fit like a glove, I would buy this item again from this seller."
"on November 29, 2016",Perfect fit of cover and keybord. Screen Gurad is bit shorter in length.
"on September 16, 2017",Looks nice and pretty color but not easy to remove once it's on.
"on November 14, 2016",I like it. The color is nice. My only complaint is the bottom half of the case does not secure on very well. Nothing major but I notice it sometimes.
"on August 31, 2017",Case doesn't snuggly fit my Mac. Gaps in the corners.
"on August 6, 2017","it took me a long time to put it on in the beginning but yeah, good quality!"
"on September 17, 2017",It was just as I expected it to be.
"on June 20, 2017",Great looking case
"on September 5, 2017",Perfect! I love it!
"on August 23, 2017",Not happy the package arrived opened.
