"on November 30, 2016",I am very satisfied and pleased with how it both looks and feels. So simple. Case snapped right on and the keyboard cover fit perfectly. Would not change a thing. The case came in 2 days so I was happy to have the case before I even bought my MacBook. Will probably buy a few other colors. Also screen protector was a nice touch.
"on November 13, 2016",Screen protector was easy to put on. Use a credit card to move air bubbles across the screen and you'll be good! Case fits snugly on my early 2015 Macbook Air and looks great. Love the colour!
"on August 19, 2016","I'm the type of person to research about a product for a couple days before purchasing it. I'm sure some people are the same way but I'm writing this review so the people like me don't have to do that! This is the second case I have purchase for my MacBook Air, the first one I purchased was the ibenzer brand. To compare: they are both very well made and too much alike to pick apart what's good and what's not. I would highly recommend either brands!!"
"on February 2, 2018","It is the greatest decision that I’ve ever made to purchase this hard-plastic case with an additional keyboard cover and screen protector. I was never a fan of online shopping because I prefer something I can see and touch. Furthermore, I have had a bad experience with online shopping in the past, so I was afraid that the same thing could happen again. However, it was urgent that I was in desperate need full protection to my laptop, so I decided to give another try.The package arrived earlier than I expected, which was within two days, as I thought it would take at least four to five days to arrive. I was very happy when I received it. Firstly, it was a completely new clear case, keyboard cover, and screen protector, without any damages. Although it is a clear case, you don’t have to worry about getting it dirty because it is stain resistant. Despite using it everyday for the last week, it still looks great without having to clean it. Secondly, the case fit my laptop perfectly. It is a snap on design where you can just fit it easily, and with the super light-weight design, you can just carry your laptop everywhere you want without a laptop bag.Besides, some of my friends would put an apple logo sticker on the case because they bought a hard case from a different website. I bought a colored case before buying this clear case. Therefore, with any colors of the cover, you don’t need to be afraid of the apple logo would disappear as it will still visible even when the case is on. As for the keyboard pad, it fits nicely, doesn’t slip off, and it helps to prevent dust. Most importantly, it is not rubbery, which means you can feel like you are typing without a keyboard protector. While the screen saver looks clear and nice, the only problem is that it is a little difficult to put on it because it has a close fit, and it was my first time applying a laptop screen protector. Luckily, it turned out great which has surprised me.You will be satisfied with this product because of its quality, and the seller has great customer service. The only thing you need to do before purchasing is to choose your favorite color and check your model number to make sure you have the right one. The price is reasonable and I think it is great for anyone who needs full protection to their laptop."
"on March 7, 2017","I love this laptop case and would highly recommend it to anyone who's thinking of buying it. I got it in a royal blue color and it came with a keyboard sleeve in the same color and a clear screen protector. I read the reviews of people putting their case on and it breaking so I was extra careful in putting mine on and successfully did it without any damages, so I suggest you do the same. I didn't use the keyboard sleeve they gave me because I had already had 2, so I felt no need for it. I also didn't use the screen protector that came with it because I thought I wouldn't need it and crumpled it up an threw it away, for only 3 days later to come and my charger hit my screen and it cracked (-__-) so yea if you think you don't need it, I highly HIGHLY suggest you put it on anyway especially if you don't have insurance on your laptop (like myself (-__-)). Lastly, because this product has a smooth matte finish and texture to it you will most likely get grease spots on it from your fingers. You can just clean them of with some window cleaner and paper towel and they'll go right away."
"on March 1, 2017","This is beautiful and feels great . Protection I'm not sure how well it will protect. The case is easy to install. The color is a beautiful turquoise Idk why it looks blue in the pictures.. It also came with a screen protector so that was nice!! Im pleased, would for sure buy more"
"on August 17, 2017","I absolutely LOVE this case!!! It's super easy to put on, and comes in such great colors! The price is super great as well for the quality of the cases and screen protector! I loved that it came with a screen protector for the laptop and that it was super easy to put on. Although I don't really use the keyboard cover when I know I will be doing a lot of typing, I do keep it on at all other times because it offers so much great protection. And this keyboard cover fit the letters and keyboard perfectly. If you are iffy about this product and a super indecisive person (like me) I would say that you can't go wrong with these products or color! (I got the camel one and it's the PERFECT shade). SUPER CLASSY!"
"on August 28, 2017","This is a good cover to protect against scratches and fingerprints. The screen protector was easy to install. A bottom part of it was bent a little due to the way it was packaged but you can barely tell by looking at it. The bottom cover snapped on easily. It took more effort to get the top cover on properly and to snap in place.  The case stays in place and does not slide. The keyboard cover aligns great. The first day I put the keyboard cover on it did not fit tightly and easily moved around. After closing the computer and opening it the next day, the cover now stays in place and does not move when typing. I can see the backlight through the cover. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I have had it for three weeks and have not had any problems. I feel it does not make the computer seem bulky. It still feels lightweight and slim."
"on January 11, 2018","This product is awesome - not only does it protect my computer (very expensive purchase) but it looks great.  Very easy installation and the package comes with everything to protect your computer.  What I liked the best is it is not designed for one size only.  I ordered this to fit my NEW Apple computer exact measurements.  Great customer service and I would recommend this company to everyone.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  I will be purchasing this again for my daughter and her new Apple.  Oh, another thought Love the keyboard protector helps me to type more accurately fingers grip keys much better."
"on January 27, 2018","The clear case gives the macbook air a nice shiny ""premium"" look and i can add/change a picture or sticker underneath it.  It snaps in easily and thin enough without adding bulk to the still rather thin MBA. There were quite some bubbles when i applied the screen saver (but it's not typically easy to apply), the bubbles i think dissipated since it's been a week now. I wold keep the outter layer on whille smoothing out the bubles as the plastic patch will leave scratch marks.  Actually the scraches seems to have dissappeared also so i'm keeping that layer on as i can still see the screen.  As for the keyboard cover, not fancy but feels crisp enough and not rubbery when typing so it's a good feel to it though plain with a frosted look. I have a translucent green case also (Ilove green) from another vendor but the clear one looks best."
"on December 27, 2016","I was not sure when I ordered the product for such a cheap price. OMG, I was so amazed by z expensive look of the products for my expensive apple. It really fit my 13.3 inch Ipad. The cover snapped to my apple as if it was custom made and the keyboard cover fit and gives a matching color with the cover itself and gives chrismatic look. I am not a person who has time to review products because of my very bussy life. But I thought it is not fair at all not to review this product as it exceeded my expectation and here I am voluntarily being a witness for my satisfaction."
"on July 9, 2017","The camel colored case leans more towards a muted tan-blushy color. Think of the Yeezy clothing line...something like that. It's beautifully matted, rubberized surface feels nice to the touch. As for the keyboard cover and screen protector...it's nice but I probably won't use it. Some of the keys on the cover were creased, so it doesn't look too good. Plus, it slows down my typing. Another great thing is that this company provides you with extra bottom case foot protectors...I always end up losing one or two after a couple months. All in all, great product! Will buy more in the future!"
"on August 17, 2017","This case fits the laptop perfectly and doesn't add much bulk or weight to the computer itself. While I don't think it will provide much protection from drops or bumps, I do think it will serve the purpose of protecting it from dirt, scratches, and the like. The color is also pretty true to the picture (I ordered the ""Pink"" color) but perhaps a shade or two darker in person.Additionally, the keyboard cover is a perfect fit, especially compared to a cover I had purchased from another brand. I didn't have to get used to it since I already used one on my old computer but suspect others who are using one for the first time will have no trouble adjusting. I also like that the keyboard cover is clear in between the keys as it looks like you've just put stickers on each of the keys - all while protecting them from dust and crumbs.I have not applied the screen protector yet but it does look like it is just short of the actual size of the screen; however this was just an added bonus and I don't find that to be too much of a problem - it will still serve its purpose of protecting the screen from scratches.Overall, this is a great deal for the 3 items that are included. If you're looking for ultimate protection for your laptop this is not the place (instead I would suggest getting a zippered laptop sleeve). If you're looking for a starting point to keep your computer clean and scratch free, this is the perfect product."
"on January 25, 2017","This case is exactly what I was looking for. It's inexpensive, well made, easy to install, and is a gorgeous blush pink color. It fits my MacBook perfectly! I was going to buy a keyboard cover separately but my type A personality loves that I was able to find a case that had a matching keyboard cover. Because, kids. Dirty hands. Dirt. Life. It also came with a screen protector, but I'm awful at installing them (and we have two toddlers and a dog who sheds like there's no tomorrow, so even though I clean daily, it's nearly impossible to get a perfectly clean screen) and it didn't work out well, but I think that's more user error than a problem with the product itself.I shelled out enough money for the computer, so I'm glad I didn't have to break the bank or this case. It's great! I'll update this review if anything changes, but so far, it's a winner."
"on January 15, 2018","It looks amazing!! I absolutely love the way it looks on my computer!! I really liked that it came with a little guide on how to put the case on (it’s not complicated but it’s good to see the proper way to put it on). I really liked that it comes with extra dots for the bottom of the computer, I thought that was pretty neat. The silicone cover fit perfectly on my computer but does have a minor mistake. It’s on the power key, it has the eject symbol however on the Mac air there is no eject feature. But that’s just being nit-picky. Everything looks and fit perfectly! Love the matt look of the case as well! Really happy with this purchase!"
"on October 6, 2017","Great addition to my MacAir. Already have dropped the Mac twice...left dents on the side. I think if I'd had this case it wouldn't have caused any damage. The case looks good -- catchy, even (I bought this one because my nephew showed up with one on his Mac and it just looked too cool to pass up. But it functions well, too.)It seems light before you attache it, but it does add a little noticeable weight to the MacAir . . . no problem, just noticeable.I didn't intend to use the keypad cover...but thought I'd try it anyway . . . kept it too. Works fine. Changes the feel of the keys somewhat, slowed down my typing speed a little at first, but you get used to it quickly.Only one real complaint: This case contains four soft plastic or rubber feet that stick to the corners of the bottom of the case. Adds a little elevation when using a desk. They are attached with something like double sided sticky tape....and they get knocked off very easily. Fortunately the case is supplied with a replacement set. So I just used a dab of super glue and stuck them on permanently."
"on July 14, 2017","I purchased the turquoise case for my MacBook Air. I just got it today so I haven't quite gotten the use out of it. It came perfectly, no cracks or imperfections. The color is true to the pictures for the most part (it looks more turquoise-y in the pictures but has more of a tint of aqua blue in person) but I still love it so far! It snapped right into place and was easy to put together. The keyboard cover falls right into place but seems like it could come out of place easily because it doesn't snap on or hold onto the keys by anything and it will definitely take some getting used to. The case doesn't seem bulky or adding heavy weight to my laptop. I just got my laptop for college and wanted something to protect my laptop from scratches and I have a high feeling that's what this case will do. Recommend."
"on September 3, 2017","Absolutely LOVE!! It's super cute. Only thing is the case is pretty see through but whatever I can still see the apple logo on the back. For 15 bucks definitely worth the money. Also the keyboard cover is an extra plus, so cute and helps protect my keyboard at the same time. The screen cover was honestly like a large square piece of tape but not really what I was buying so I don't mind that. Everything is exactly like the picture. I bought mint green and it's adorable, kinda wanting hot pink but it's ok. The case is extremely hard to remove. I'm afraid it'll crack if I try too hard. So it's not good if you plan to swap cases so often."
"on June 17, 2017","I love this case because it still gives my Mac the sleek minimalist look, but now in my favorite color! I use my computer frequently since I do a lot of programming work and take my laptop everywhere with me. After 3 months of use though, all of the white ""feet"" on the bottom part of the case have fallen off (they were just glued on). Also, the keyboard cover has loosened and they keys that I use frequently have rubbed off (other keys look completely fine). I also just recently realized that the keyboard cover covers up the speakers, so music is slightly muted. Otherwise, the cover is very thick and opaque. Nothing else has chipped. I love how it looks."
"on March 29, 2017","I absolutely love the product and when I received it, came very well packaged and also with a screen protector!! How awesome! I loved my laptop case and would definitely purchase again. Also, after being an amazon customer for years, I have never recieved an email from the sellers to make sure I am happy with my product so I am now even more happy! Thank you! Also the color was beautiful and shiny"
"on April 24, 2017","I've never really had a ""real"" case for my MacBook, mainly because I was too lazy to search for one. Sadly, my old case had finally fallen apart and I was forced to start looking and I found something that was both simple and elegant. I needed a case that was going to provide protection, mainly from me eating food over top my laptop and also look good doing so. Luckily, I found exactly what I was looking for, this isn't an otter box for your laptop and at this price, I hope that's not what you're looking for. If you need something that is inexpensive and good enough then that's what this case is primarily for, I love it and it looks great and I recommend it to those who understand it's duties."
"on February 10, 2018","I ordered Peacock green and when I received it, it looked lighter and nothing like the picture. it looks darker when on the actual computer. I really don't know if I like the color and kind of wish I got the purple or teal! But for the price, I may get a new color in time. Also, for the price, this is fantastic. It feels like my speck cases from my old MacBook years ago. My only complaint-which does not warrant a lower rating-is that finger prints/greasy marks are on the laptop after touching it. I mean...fine. for the price, it protects my computer and that's why I bought it. I didn't use the screen cover, but the keyboard cover is nice because I killed a MacBook in my day spilling Diet Coke on the keys....so this makes me feel better! Definitely recommend this product."
"on January 18, 2018",Great case for the price I spent. The only thing I would say I wasn't a huge fan of is the little tabs that are used to secure it to the computer stick up a little but that is no reason not to get this case. It is a very sturdy case and has ventilation slots on the bottom to let it breath during heavy usage. My last one didn't and It wouldn't let the heat dissipate.
"on February 5, 2018","This is my first review. I am one of those people who when I see something online that I like I go through all the reviews, I research about it, watch videos, take days to decide, etc..! I just bought this product a few days ago and received it in the mail today. I LOVE it. It fits great and looks beautiful! The color I got was the serenity blue. I was scared it was going to be to purple for my taste (I’m more of a blue gal) but it’s actually gorgeous. I really like the screen protector too. You just have to take it slow when applying it, but It looks great hardly any bubbles and their minuscule. Plus they give you a little card to help push away the bubbles. If your like me and worry about it and do crazy research your search can end now. I say go for it because so far I love it. Also I didn’t include a picture, but light does show through the keypad cover, which is a plus! 5 stars!"
"on February 3, 2017","I've only had this case for a few hours but I LOVE IT!The color is beautiful! It comes with a front and bottom click on case,rubber keyboard cover and a screen protector.I have the new MacBook Air and the case weighs the back down a bit so when I pick the laptop up the screen leans back. It's not an issue just an observation. The keyboard helps with us hard types which results in loud keyboard tapping!I love the product! If I get bored with the color (I won't!) I would definitely get a new one from this company!"
"on January 25, 2018","This is my second purchase and this time I bought two more (turquoise and light purple).  The colors are so vivid and I like being able to switch up the colors and have fun with them.  I bought one last year in rose pink and the color is so bright and pretty.  Structurally, the keyboard cover and laptop cover have held up quite well. Since I'm in school, it's nice to have a cover that's unique and sets my laptop aside from everyone else's."
"on September 5, 2017","My first thoughts: I love the color. I decided to get camel and boy am I glad I did that. Usually, laptop covers last for awhile so I don't normally change them too quickly. That's why I really place a lot of importance on me not getting tired of the color. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect with the color camel but it doesn't disappoint. It's not pastel or too brown but it's like a nice dusty pink with brown tones thats matte to the touch and frankly quite great. Now onto the comparisons: I've tried out a couple of different laptop covers and they were all good. The one thing I liked about this product compared to the others though is the fact that it came with a screen protector. A lot of other companies sell similar products but without a screen protector. If the price is the same, why not just get this product? I'm really happy with my purchase and will probably buy from here again in the future! Great job!"
"on January 25, 2018","The quality of this product is excellent  for the price. I’ve bought other cases from other brands for double the price and they scratch and crack easily. This case is easy to snap on and easy to take off. The surfaces are smooth. I love that it comes with a matching color cover for the keyboard, a screen protector and a cleaning wipe.  I highly recommend it. I can’t really say there is anything that I dislike about it—your fingerprints do show a little easily but that’s because of the matte  finish—that I love and you can easily wipe it away."
"on February 4, 2018","Suuuuuper cute, feels really sturdy and I think it definitely keeps my computer much safer. The keyboard cover makes me type a little slower (you have to press a little harder on keys), but that's to be expected as it is Supposed to cover the keys. Absolutely love the color too, (it's the wine/berry-ish color). Would definitely buy again."
"on February 1, 2017","tbh, pink is not my favorite color and I was kinda disappointed when I unwrapped the parcel... this rose gold is looking way pinkish than I thought... BUT i was wrong! The faded pink actually look awesome on my mac and i LOVE the apple light that shines through the cover... so PRETTY! everything fits perfectly to my 13""MacAir : )  great price for such combination! owhyea, and the quality of this product is what I'm looking for: doesn't feel like a plastic material, more on fabric-like kinda feeling- smoother and better quality. overall, love it!"
"on October 8, 2017","I love this case so far. It looks amazing with my MacBook Air 13.3'. I was hesitant at first because I have the newest MacBook Air that was released this year (2017). However, the case proved me wrong and fits well with my Macbook. The keyboard cover is nice for the price I had to pay for the trio, but it actually is just a thin layer of plastic. I have yet to put the screen protector on but I compared the screen protector to my screen. The screen protector is the same size as the MacBook screen."
"on January 23, 2018"," This case is so nice, I love the matte/rubberized texture along with the keyboard cover. I ordered the Peacock Green color and it looks amazing especially if you love this shade of green. It does make the laptop a little heavier. I would definitely order this again."
"on October 10, 2017","I waited to write a review to see how my case and keyboard protector held up, and I have not been disappointed. It got to me without damage, it was easy to pop on, the keyboard cover is easy to clean and it doesn't have any wear down. I am not very hard on my computer, but I do use it everyday for school work. The case is lightweight, but not very heavy duty. If I accidentally dropped my computer I feel that the case would take the brunt of the hit, but would need to be replaced. It does the job well, has style and function. I would purchase it again."
"on December 28, 2017","I Like IT!  Most of all I feel my devise is protected.  A bonus is the Key Pad cover.  Could be in my head, but I think the key pad cover actually makes it easier to use the key board, as the keyboard digits are closer together than a standard keyboard.  I'm a new mac user, and I have a challenge with the keyboards."
"on April 3, 2017","This case is an incredible investment. I purchased a MacBook Air that I want to keep in good condition for as long as possible. I chose to purchase this case because I wanted the slim protection provided by a Spec Case but I didn't want to spend $50 on a case. This case snaps on simply and keeps the MacBook Air's incredible design lines. It also comes with a silicon keyboard protector and a clear screen film, which I didn't know about when I chose to purchase the case. All in all, the price was right for an incredible amount of protection."
"on June 16, 2017","Okay so I was obviously really skeptical about buying something like this online. I wondered if the quality would be good and if I would be full of regret after buying this. But very happily, I and my sister are VERY pleased with this product! The shell snaps on, the screen protector is the perfect size and the keyboard cover works well! Very happy. This green though, is very lime green. My sister loves it because she loves green. However, I am not a green person and am glad I got mine in wine. Totally worth every penny. You will not find a better deal. Seriously, I've tried looking and read ALOT of reviews before I went with this seller. Quality goods. Ours are not shiny though. We got matte. And I personally love it."
"on May 13, 2017",I bought this item for my laptop. I loved the color and when I received the item in the mail the color looked even better than the pictures. The case feels super nice and soft. It is plastic but a high quality plastic that I feel won't scratch your laptop which was exactly what I was looking for. The keyboard cover fits perfectly on my laptop keyboards making it look perfectly purple. This case cover was way better than my last one and if I ever need to I will purchase for this brand again maybe even get the maroon/red colored case!
"on June 27, 2017",I got this for my daughters MacBook. Make sure you check the model number to make sure that you have the right one. I got a purple one for my laptop about a year ago and never had any problems so I decided to get one for her. The keyboard cover is awesome and the cover is great
"on February 3, 2018","Snapped on perfectly to my Macbook and shows off the stickers I already had on there. It does make the laptop heavier obviously, so keep that in mind. But it is crystal clear and SOLID. I feel like my laptop is very protected. It also came with a screen protector and a keyboard cover!"
"on May 23, 2017","I am in love with this laptop case!  The color is definitely a sand. I really like the feel of it and was hoping it wasn't that cheap looking ahiny plastic type and it's not shiny at all! It's smooth, matte, and worth every penny!  One thing that I have to mention for other potential buyers is that from one of my pictures you can see that one of the little white things from the bottom is missing. It came off about a month later. It doesn't bother me but it may bother others so just putting it out there. It's a great deal overall and would recommend."
"on August 23, 2017","I absolutely love this hard case and the cover! It's so sleek and sturdy as well, my package came in fast too which is another bonus! I am in LOVE with the color it looks exactly like the one shown and I love the matte look and it just feels so smooth and nice. It came with a silicone keyboard cover which was another nice little bonus and I just love how my MacBook looks with it on! Not to mention a screen protector too. I love the case as well the inside is nice and fuzzy. It's a really nice combo."
"on January 15, 2018","this is a must for any computer, i especially love the color, i actually tell people who are using laptops to get this product, as many people as use starbucks, one would have to be crazy not to get a case with keyboard cover,  it's as important as a cell phone case"
"on January 23, 2018","I could not be more pleased with this purchase. This is an inexpensive way to personalize your computer while giving it some extra protection from the everyday wear and tear in and out of a computer bag. The outer case easily snaps on and the keyboard cover can be pulled off, clorox wiped and slips right back on. Colleagues at my office are slowly catching on to these and purchasing them - if you are considering one, I fully endorse it! And, this seller in particular delivered it faster than anticipated. Five stars!"
"on March 6, 2017","The cover, keyboard cover, and screen were exactly what I was looking for. Everything came packaged really well, and the case snapped on really easily. My only *small* qualms would be that the color isn't as ""plum"" as I would have liked, but the red still looks really good with my Mac. Also, the keyboard cover does adhere nicely but it isn't as snug as I would like. Other than that, everything was just as ordered! I would definitely order it again in other colors."
"on September 21, 2017","So far, so good! The only thing that someone might find a little annoying is that the screen protector is slightly smaller than the screen. But honestly, it's not noticeable unless you look really close at the screen. The keyboard cover still lets the key-light feature work and the case itself is not bulky or heavy. Also, color is accurate to what you see in the picture. I will definitely re purchase this product when it's time for a new case : )"
"on November 4, 2017","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!! Everything you need in one purchase!! I've been using it for a month now, and I am happy every time I see this color. My dog recently sneezed on me, and I was soooo glad that I have the keyboard and screen covers!"
"on October 13, 2017","They look just like the picture. (: The outer part of the shell feels rubbery, almost like the same feeling as the silicone keyboard, and I believe the inner side of the shell is tough and sturdy. I also love the silicone keyboard, it prevents the keys from being dirty. Bless! I will definitely buy a different color in the future. :) One more thing is that I wanna thank the company for adding a small card to get rid of the air bubbles when you apply the screen saver. Thanks again!!"
"on January 25, 2018","I am 100% satisfied with this product. What I appreciate most is that it was very easy to attach to my Macbook Air, easily snapping into place and it fits perfectly, nice and snug. The keyboard cover fits nicely and feels quite natural. And it was a pleasant surprise that the kit comes with a screen protector as well. Finally, the color is true to the shade shown on the website. In summary, this product is excellent and a great price.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
"on August 8, 2017","I like it a lot, I brought the black case. It makes my Macbook Air look super mean haha. I haven't tried putting the screen protector yet but it seems like the same process as putting on a phone screen protector. The case looks and feels pretty durable. It feels like a matte kinda rubber. The keyboard cover is easy to put on, and easy to clean. It also came with extra rubber thingys just in case!"
"on July 14, 2017","so far I love my case, key pad, the screen protector I was not able to get the protector on straight but it ok.love the color an it fit perfectly,love the logo that added an extra look to my computer, everything is GREAT at this point, thank you.."
"on September 19, 2017","I've had the Rose Quartz case on my MacBook Air for about 5 months, and I love it! The product is very light and easy to pop on and off. The case has held up well with no cracks, and I am pretty tough on my computer! All of the rubber feet are still in place, and my computer doesn't get as hot with the ventilation slots. Love the case! Plus, it was WAY cheaper than comparable products and just as good - I highly recommend this product!"
"on July 18, 2017",Perfect. This is the second case I've bought from MOsiso. I love the purple. Only thing I don't like is the fingerprints which I did not notice on the last case I purchased from this company but doesn't bother me enough to take away a star..:)
"on January 3, 2018","Our son has a computer cover on his Christmas list. We went in blind, taking a chance & bought one that matched his school colors. With a little over 1 1/2 weeks of use he is pleased with the fit and performance of the selection. It was affordably priced too."
"on November 17, 2016","UPDATE 11/28/16: This was the best customer service I have dealt with on Amazon. They sent me another screen protector after they reached out to see how everything was. It arrived 3 days later. Also, the keyboard protector is in daily use- just takes some getting used to, but it works great. Overall very satisfied with the whole experience and will buy again from Mosiso.Case works perfect. The screen protector ended up in the trash after a long tedious battle that was beyond frustrating (at least to a perfectionist like me).Currently typing with the keyboard protector. Not great- every other space bar hit misses the input.Overall great case but the freebies are underwhelming."
"on January 23, 2018",Great cover for the price. Fits our MacBook Air (2017) perfect. Came quickly with Prime. Also comes with keyboard cover & screen protector. You’d never find this set for this price at a Apple Store. Worth the order.
"on January 29, 2018","I bought the rose quartz case for my Macbook Air (2017 model) and it fit perfectly! There is only one small latch on the top of the computer that I can't latch all the way, but that might be because I don't want to press hard enough or it may not bend that way. Still, even with that small tiny flaw, the case in pretty much perfect.  The cover for the keyboard doesn't move and feels soft on my fingers, I know that my case is doing its job and protecting from everything I fear. I love it! It's the perfect case at a decent price!"
"on September 2, 2017","I purchased this for the excellent reviews on the hard cover case.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and It protects my computer and stays on without any issues.  I liked the keyboard cover for the appearance, but I find it makes it more difficult to type so I mostly choose not to use it.  I considered the keyboard cover and screen protector a bonus since this product cost just as much or less than most other products that came with a hard case alone.  For that reason, it doesn't bother me that I don't use the keyboard cover.  If you're looking for a hard cover that gets the job done and looks nice doing so, I recommend this one."
"on January 18, 2018","This is absolutely the most perfect cover possible!!  Fits like a glove, and is gorgeous!  Just look at get color!  It arrived way sooner than expected, it couldn't have been more than 2 days.  5 stars all the way."
"on November 18, 2017",Fits computer.  First order was for a smaller computer due to packaging mix up- order rectified and corrected order worked nicely.Have used Mosiso plastic hard cases for several years - a good value and hold up.
"on July 31, 2017","I LOVE this case ! Perfect fit, awesome feel, definitely worth more than the price. The keyboard cover fits seamlessly over the keys and the screen protector is an add plus. This is basically a steal ! 10/10 would recommend."
"on January 8, 2018","Love it, it has a matte finish not shiny. You can see the Apple logo through the cover. The key pad is great but the letters are white and if you can't type it may be a problem. The letters don't stand out much."
"on December 10, 2016","Hey guys,I'm writing to update my review, I feel so horrible. It was my fault I didn't want to push the cover onto my new laptop so I was doing it too lightly. Finally when I placed it down I noticed it wasn't buckled in right and it didn't take much to push it in and get it to click into place.It's been an awesome protector for my laptop. I love the purple cover, it's my favorite color.The screen protector was a bit tough to put on there but, I think that was my fault because I got too excited while trying to place it on the screen.Overall, amazing. Thank you guys!!"
"on July 4, 2017","Um, for the price, i can't complain.  Seems built well.  the keyboard cover is OK, but I don't do a lot of typing.  I mainly just watch netflix and videos on my MacBook Air.  If you plan to do a lot of typing, i think the keyboard cover would get in the way.  Very pretty hard case!  Love the rose gold."
"on January 25, 2017",The case is perfect. Beautiful color. The owner of the company reached out after my purchase via email to see if I was happy with the product.  I had purchased a different color for my daughter for Christmas but she wanted this instead.  It cost almost as much to return the other one as it was to buy it so not worth to return.  I explained the situation. They worked with me personally to exchange the case so my daughter would be happy.  Amazing customer service from Mosiso.  Very impressed.  Especially on such an inexpensive item.  Don't hesitate to buy from this company.
"on July 19, 2017","Sharp looking royal blue case for my Mac air 13"". The keyboard protection is excellent and I love the blue on the keyboard. I also placed the protective screen on and that was very easy to do. All in all well worth the money."
"on June 30, 2017",Better than I ever expected for my MacBook Air.  Snaps in place very easily and I'm even using the keyboard cover.  Saves a lot of wear and tear.  It also make the Air easier to pick up and handle.
"on July 15, 2017","I recently bought it for my MacBook Air and I like it. I bought it in the color camel. The shade itself is very nice, like a soft earth tone. Not too brown and not a whole lot of pink, it's the right shade. The cover is a nice soft rubber material. The keyboard fits great. I'm excited to use it cause now I could eat extra hot cheetos and type at the same time. I managed to get the screen protector on with very few air bubbles. Everything fits great. It's a great purchase yall"
"on March 6, 2017","This Hard case was amazing. The fact that this was 14 dollars, came with keyboard cover, a hard case, and a screen protector is totally worth it. The version I bought was a bright red, this color was very nice and the hard case is slightly see through, which allows for the apple logo to shine. The package also had a small, white piece of plastic to push out any air bubbles after placing the screen protector, which was a nice touch and very helpful. Lastly, I also received extra white grips for the legs of the bottom half of the hard, plastic case in case they slide off or are broken, which again, was a nice touch. Overall I am extremely pleased with this product and would highly recommend."
"on January 3, 2017","Love it! At first I was having difficulties snapping it on cause i didn't want to damage my MacBook but after it finally snapped on it was perfect! The keyboard may be the least of my liking. I like the color but it kinda defeats the purpose of the backlighting on the keyboard, as you can't really see the lighting through the keyboard protector. Overall, it is a great product."
"on July 27, 2017","Sleek, good coverage for you basic laptop needs. This case is not too thick or too thin, it fit perfectly on the first try and the screen protector is a nice bonus that comes with the case! I bought the aqua blue version which is between navy and light blue. The extra foot stubs are also a plus in case they fall of or break. The only thing I would say is a con is that the case itself shows the pils from your hands so if you care about that you would just have to clean it every now and again."
"on February 7, 2018","Great product for the price, it fit my computer perfectly. The keyboard slides off at times but still nice to have in order to protect the keys.  I purchased two and would recommend them."
"on February 6, 2018","Love it! The case itself is smooth and nice. Super easy to apply. The silicone keyboard cover quality is okay. It makes it difficult to see keyboard lit up. It will give you basic coverage and it looks cute! The screen protector is nice, it is not too difficult to put it on. Overall, very satisfied with this product! The color is Rose Quartz. Would recommend!"
"on January 17, 2018",Great hard plastic case. Easy to install and looks great. The keyboard cover stays in place and it is difficult to notice that it is there when typing.This is probably the best hard cover case I have purchased on Amazon and will continue to use Mosiso when I need a hard case.
"on December 31, 2017","Product fits great on the new 13” MacBook Air. No issues with cover. Comes with rear cover, front cover, keyboard cover and screen cover. The Apple logo can still be seen through the rear cover."
"on August 26, 2017","I've been using this cover for about three weeks and it does the job. My labtop fell from a table during a TSA check and it protected my mac from the fall. The screen protector was easy to apply. I say it's a great product for the price. I bought another one for my sister to use. She is in college and is more ""rough"" with her mac so i will update my review if she has any additional information. The color matched the image in Amazing as well."
"on November 6, 2017",My wife loves it. It gives a very good protection. The screen protection came very handy as she has a habit to touching the screen. At least it may protect agains nail scratches.
"on October 9, 2017",This protector for my MacBook Air is amazing! I absolutely love the color and the material. I love that it came with a cover for the keypads and that it’s the same color. Overall very good quality and worth it. Good customer service as well.
"on August 31, 2017","This is such a great case for the MacBook Air. The keyboard cover kept my keyboard dry when I accidentally knocked over my water. The case doesn't scratch the computer, nor does itself easily scratch."
"on November 20, 2017",This product fits perfect on my daughter's mac book air. It is strong and made out of high quality plastic. Also can’t say enough of their customer service. They went above and beyond to help us with a warranty replacement.
"on January 5, 2018","Seems to work great. Easy to snap on, and the screen protector went on with only 1 bubble stuck under it (my fault). The keyboard protector makes typing a bit trickier, but overall I'm happy."
"on April 6, 2017","Can't beat the price of this case, and the quality is pretty great! Exactly what I needed for my laptop- I will definitely order again if I ever want to change up the color."
"on February 25, 2017","After much searching on Amazon for a hard cover for my daughter's MacBook Air (there are many many options), I decided to try the one by Mosiso. Couldn't be happier. Not only is the price great, but it is superior protection on my $1000+ investment with Apple!"
"on January 4, 2018","It easily comes off, but stays on with a perfect fit, the matching keyboard cover is the icing on the cake.I haven't used the screen protector, didn't see a use for it."
"on January 13, 2017","I bought this product years ago, about 6 years to be exact from the same company here on Amazon. One of the clips broke off that clips on to the lap top screen. The new one I received is amazing. I will keep puchasing from them. The keyboard pad is a life saver since I tend to snack when I'm working. Definitely cannot beat the price for the quality you get. Must buy!"
"on December 29, 2017","This case snaps right into place easily! A little difficult to take the bottom one off, but that’s a good thing to know it’s actually protected. I didn’t care too much for the keypad protector. Made it a little more difficult to type with it."
"on October 22, 2017",Super fast delivery came to me the next day.  Wow.  Luv the color choices and the product is exactly what I needed and wanted.  It's a must buy if you have an Apple Laptop.  Love it!!
"on September 25, 2017",I love it. It fits perfectly for the Mac air and was very easy to put on
"on December 1, 2017","Very Nice! Absolutely A Great Value Work More Than I Paid!Very Very Nice Case Fits Like A Glove Perfect!My 8 Year Old, My Bad 8 And Half Year Old Loves It!"
"on April 6, 2017","Absolutely love it! Fits excellently, the keyboard cover is perfect. The color is amazing. I couldn't ask for a better product!!"
"on December 27, 2017",This product is perfect for my daughter's 13 inch MacBook Air. The quality is amazing and the clear keyboard cover allows the backlit keyboard to be perfectly seen. The keyboard cover is thin is quite ergonomic and feels so comfortable on the fingers.
"on November 29, 2016","I recently purchased this cover for my Air 13 Macbook which included a keyboard cover and screen protector. The cover fits perfectly and is very soft to the touch but sturdy. The keyboard cover is really nice and not only covers the keys in the same color to match the case, but provides a cushiony-feel as I type. The screen cover was easily applied and adds extra protection to the computer.When I first purchased my computer several years ago, I bought a hard plastic case at the Apple store; it was very expensive and ultimately cracked with normal use. The Mosiso case appears to be much more durable and is extremely reasonable in price. I highly recommend it!"
"on February 14, 2017","The laptop case is wonderful. It is durable, protective, and the color is very true to the rose gold iphone! The keypad cover is rubbery and stays in place. I am having trouble adjusting to it, not because there is anything wrong with it, I am just not accustomed to typing with a key pad cover. I have not used the screen cover at all. But I will once I can get my screen really clean!The case is the most critical part of this ensemble and it is really good. I've owned a few and this is by far the most durable. But still slim and elegant."
"on January 17, 2018","I was pleasantly surprised because the set was very affordable and the quality of the case and keyboard cover were as good as anything else in the market. This is hands down the best buy for the buck on amazon and any store you could walk into. I have bought lots of these type of covers over the years, and I will never buy anything else but Mosiso."
"on August 25, 2017","I ordered this item to protect my Macbook Air.  It's a perfect fit!  It does a great job of doing so and I am totally pleased with it.  It protects the outer cover from scratches and will give a buffer if I accidentally drop it.  The keyboard cover keeps the keys looking clean and adds protection from dust, crumbs, etc. and in case of an accidental spill, it will protect it from the liquids getting down in my keyboard.  The clear cover for my screen is an added bonus and fit the screen nicely."
"on February 11, 2018","fits my 2017 MacBook Air perfectly, looks like a second skin and barely noticeable but provides the level of protection I desired. I do not use the key board cover because it doesn't stay on."
"on June 21, 2017","Case snapped right into place, I didn't use the screen protector (didn't really need it).. The keyboard cover is AWESOME a huge win for this company!!"
"on February 27, 2017","This is my second mosiso case of my MacBook air and this one is just as great as the last one. (Only bought a new one so I could try a different color.) My first one, however didn't come with a screen protector or keyboard cover, which I didn't see as a problem then, but now having these things are definitely a plus! The only awkward part was trying to get the screen protector on well. It took a couple trys and multiple cleaning cloths, but it looks good now and will hopefully function well!"
"on November 7, 2017","Amazing case!! Color is beautiful!! Also, I've bought a lot of computer cases over the years, and no matter how well they're made, the little pieces at on the bottom always seem to fall off. THIS CASE COMES WITH EXTRAS!! This is the first time I have seen a case come with extra foam pieces for the bottom!! Thank you!! 10/10 would recommend!!"
"on December 9, 2016","I love the computer case. The color is perfect. Only down side is the off alignment of the keyboard letters from the rubber cover. Its not bothersome with the keyboard light is completely off so I can't notice it, but I would like to use the feature of having a keyboard light once in a while but besides that everything was perfect."
"on December 11, 2016",This is really nice case and keyboard cover.  It was super easy to put on but I'm not sure how easy it will be to take off when I decide to change. I don't want to damage my laptop. I did request info as to how difficult it will be but have not heard back.
"on October 25, 2017","Love this laptop case! It conforms perfectly to my Macbook Air and makes me feel much more secure. This weekend I accidentally dropped my laptop from a top bunk bed and the laptop and case came out completely unscathed. I ordered the clear matte color, which I love. Only downside is the color/texture very easily shows fingerprints where the case has been touched. Not sure if these can be cleaned off or not."
"on January 22, 2018",I ordered this case because my daughter had one & I really liked the feel. It's smooth but it also feels like you have a better hold on the laptop. It takes a bit to get used to the keyboard cover. It's nice that it has a raised area on the F & J just as a regular keyboard does so that you know you have your fingers in the correct place before you type. Next time I order I will order a darker color. Arrived in good shape & quickly.
"on January 5, 2017","I purchased the Mosiso Plastic Hard Case and Keyboard Cover as a gift for my 21 year old niece to go with her MacBook Air. She L-O-V-E-S it! The Tiffany Blue colored case is attractive and really makes the MacBook Air ""pop""!  It took my niece seconds (if not a few minutes) to install the case and it fits like a glove. I'm tempted to buy more colors to coordinate with my outfits but that might be a bit over the top. Highly recommend this case and thought the cost was reasonable."
"on February 3, 2017",This was unexpectedly great. It's really holding on to the laptop. Very very satisfied. It came with the keyboard and the screen protector. It's pretty cheap and the 3 items that you need to protect your computer is already with it. 👌🏻
"on May 14, 2017","All fit great, especially the keyboard cover.  So much nicer compared to one I bought last year that was three times as much.  The covers were heavier than I thought but that is part of the protection.  Highly recommend"
"on March 28, 2017","This case was so much better than I expected. My boyfriend also has a Mac and has to buy a new case every couple months but he spends $45 on nicer brand name cases. This case is very sturdy and has given me no issues, and came with such a good price! Mine feels sturdy and slightly rubberized on top of the hard shell, and seems nicer than the one my boyfriend spent three times the money on, I'll keep coming back for these!"
"on December 14, 2016","Purchased this because my MacBook was new and felt like I needed something to protect it, and this case is perfect. It's protective but also stylish. I love that the apple still does shine through it, I got the camel color. The keyboard cover is also great. I hate dirty keyboards so I popped it on right away and it feels very comfortable and still easy to type with. The screen protector is a bonus, but I haven't put it on yet just because I suck at putting on screen protectors."
"on October 20, 2017","So pretty, easy to apply. Key board covers are a game changer. You have to get used to typing on it at first, but if you eat at your computer a lot it’s so essential. I love it and want different colors!"
"on March 30, 2017",Excellent cover. 3rd one I hVe purchased for a family member. They are great to protect your outside but they don't do jack if you drop it
"on March 19, 2017",This is a nice computer cover. The color is the same as pictured. It's a very soft pink and it installs very easily. Shipping was quick too.
"on January 3, 2017","This case is exactly what I was looking for. It just snaps on the top and the bottom in 2 seconds and gives some protection without covering the inside of computer. It is plastic but has a soft rubber coating, which is nice. The keypad cover fits nicely and will give some protection against dirt and splashes, although if there were a major spill it might give you a second or two to react. Hope it will standup to daily use. Going to tell husband to get one for his new laptop."
"on September 4, 2016","This fit my MacBook Air case perfectly. It was super easy to snap in place and looks good. I'm not really into keyboard protectors or screen protectors in general so I didn't end up using those, but the case itself is exactly what I wanted. It's hard plastic and is thin so that from far away you can't even tell there's a case on it. Thankfully not bulky"
"on August 13, 2016","the color is beautiful and pretty accurate as the one shown in the description/photo. Amazing deal [ 3 in 1 ]. the screen protector does its job but the size of it is a little of; the protector when put on the screen doesn't fully touch from one side to other. but its not something major because you can barely notice it. the keyboard padding covers the keyboard very well but in my opinion, its little tougher to type with it on because it adds more texture so its not as lightweight when u type with it off. but besides that, I'm really enjoying the protection and the color and especially with the affordable price"
"on March 27, 2017","Well worth the money, I've been using these cases for the past several years and they have saved my MBA from scratches and dents and possible worse due to accidental bumps and falls. I have the clear case, it's a bit shiny and shows very few fingerprints and is easy to clean. The keyboard cover is brilliant, keeping the keyboard safe from daily dirt and any tragic liquid spill."
"on August 25, 2017","Everything came in perfect condition, nothing broken or chipped! The color is also just as pretty as I expected to be. Even came with a screen protector which I didn't know was included.  The only problem, which isn't that big of a problem to me, the color of the keyboard pad doesn't match perfectly with the outside covers. It's a bit lighter but I don't mind at all because both shades are very pretty, but if that would bother you, keep that in mind."
"on September 25, 2017","I just order this for my new Mac (13"") .I am very satisfied with the procuct. Feels nice at touch and fits"
"on March 8, 2017","Good quality, nice texture, and easy to snap onto the laptop. Fits well too. The only thing I didn't prefer were the air vents that open on the bottom of the case (not sure if this is being described accurately). The Macbook Air doesn't ""breathe"" through it's bottom, so I'm not quite sure there are air vents placed there. That being said, this design doesn't hinder the functionality or general aesthetics of the item."
"on May 5, 2017",Love it! For my laptop perfectly and now I don't have to be so careful when using it or around my two year old who likes to touch it with greasy fingers.
"on September 5, 2017","Maybe should have gotten a darker color, since my hand is sweaty sometimes it leaves marks on it, but other than that it is a great quality product."
"on December 9, 2017",I found the cover to be an easy snap-on adaptation that helps give me some piece of mind about protecting my MacBook Air.  It fit perfectly.  I'm using the keyboard cover without any hindrance to my keyboarding skills: speed and accuracy.  I haven't applied the screen protector yet as I'm uncertain about its necessity.  Will research that.  Glad I made this purchase.  The product and shipper are dependable.
"on July 31, 2017","Great case.  Solid.  Seems like it will last for as long as I need it to.  Fits perfectly.  No problems installing at all.  Keyboard protector also fits great.  Had my doubts about it, but very pleasantly surprised.  Screen protector is nice too, but like most screen protectors, hard to install without getting bubbles.  Shipping was very fast.  Was delivered in one day."
"on March 21, 2017",Love it!!!  color is awesome...and very easy to. snap into. place!!!  so happy I waited to get home and purchase this instead of buying one at the Apple Store!!!
"on January 6, 2018","I bought a Mosiso case for my macbook pro about 2 years ago and loved it so much I decided to get one as a gift for a friend. Mine fit perfectly and didn't feel cheap at all. When I received the case for the Air, a corner had cracked and actually fallen off. I contacted Mosiso customer support directly about it was immediately sent a full replacement without having to send the old one back! Love the case and the support! Highly recommended."
"on September 23, 2016","The case is a little more lavender than periwinkle, but it is still a gorgeous, calming color and I'm so pleased I bought it. The keyboard cover stays on so well; it actually gave me a bit of trouble when I tried to take it off, which I took as a great sign! It comes with a screen protector, as well, which I have yet to put on because I'm sure I would probably do it wrong. My only con of this case was that it was a bit tricky to get fully clipped on, but once that's done, it's good to go!"
"on November 4, 2017","Own this in many colors - it does a great job of protecting my laptop and the keyboard cover is perfect for quieting the keys and keeping dirt and dust out of the laptop. Everyone in my office was jealous of my covers, so this is now a company-wide staple"
"on March 8, 2017",I love this cover! I just go a new macbook & this case with the keyboard give it a special touch. They fit perfectly. The color is the same as listed too. Very satisfied!
"on July 19, 2017","Fits well, looks good, screen protector was easy to put on, as was the keyboard cover.  Put in a mid 2012 13"" MacBook Air."
"on September 6, 2017",Easy to install. Sturdy yet not bulky. Nice color. I'm tempted to purchase another one of a different color just to spice up my computer life a bit 😂.
"on January 6, 2017",I looked for about two weeks for a hard case for my MacBook && when I came across this product I fell in love. The hard case is smooth not that rough plastic. The keyboard over is great material. The screen protector I didn't use. I thought it would be pointless but that's just my opinion. The color is BEAUTIFUL.
"on January 20, 2018",Very stylish and easy to attach to my Mac. Still getting used to keyboard cover but a great product to keep you computer free from scratches and adds a nice flair as well!
"on September 2, 2017","I got the camel color, and absolutely love it. It's more of a taupe or light mushroom color, but it's beautifully neutral. It takes a bit to get used to the keyboard cover, but love how the cover kind of sticks to the keys. The case was easy to apply to my computer. It snaps on.Overall, a great color and awesome product! If I ever need another one, I'd choose this one again. The photos are very helpful for color selection!"
"on August 23, 2017","The product worked great! Easy to hook onto the computer, looks beautiful. The keyboard cover fits PERFECT, even though some people said its misaligned. Mine was not so maybe it varies by customer.. Overall though I am extremely happy with this."
"on September 18, 2016",Really pretty color (the light blue). Nice matte finish and I love the included keyboard cover and the screen protector. It also comes with extra little grippy feet for the bottom which is great because those always fall off my computer cases. This first set hasn't fallen off yet though. Lovely case!
"on May 28, 2017","This case has been very good! The bottom corner of the case broke, I emailed Mosiso, and they agreed to ship me another! I would give 100 stars in a heartbeat! The case fits well, and is stylish! The keyboard skin looks very cool with the backlit keyboard, and keeps your keyboard VERY clean! LOVE IT!!!! Also 5 stars for Customer Service! I emailed them last night, and they responded immediately! Best customer service ever!"
"on September 17, 2017","Very great case, I love it! I've had it only a couple of weeks and have already gotten so many compliments on it! I loved how it came with a keyboard cover and screen protector as well. The only complaint I have is that the white circular things on the bottom of the laptop case come off very easily, especially when I am doing homework on my laptop and using a blanket, I keep finding the little white stickers come off and need to replace them."
"on March 4, 2017","The case great for added protection for my macbook air. I'm most pleased with the keyboard mat; it keeps dust out of my keyboard and it fits well onto the keys. Typing is something to get used to with it on. The case snaps on easily and fits well. The package comes with extra round feet for the bottom in case the ones attached fall off. The mint color is nice and it has a matte finish, so I don't see any scratches so far."
"on January 15, 2018","Amazing case I really loved it more then I thought I would. It fits snugg on my computer, the packaging keeps it scratch free and easy to place. It also come with a keyboard cover and screen protect (I didn’t read the description so it was a pleasant surprise). The keyboard protector fits snug and tight unlike others I have had before. The same can be said for the screen protector!"
"on July 18, 2017",Great product and protects my computer very well. It was a great price and the colors are brilliant. Would definitely recommend this company.
"on March 22, 2017",Very happy with my new case. I like that it came with the keyboard cover which keeps the computer keyboard clean and looking new. The green is a celery color. Case is easy to snap on and protects the computer from scratches. It arrived on time. Also there are many colors to choose from
"on December 10, 2017",This case is very well made.For the price it is by far the Best deal. The case went on in two minutes.  The clear case shows off tbe macbook air and protects it .
"on January 8, 2018",We received this for my son and it for perfectly on his computer. The product came in a timely matter as well. The only complaint I have is  I actually bought a color he didn't want. It was very pretty just not for him. To return the first color I had to pay shipping which cost over have the price of the item. So we kept it. I am hoping to sell. This product is not expensive I liked the price point.
"on November 28, 2017","Hated the clear screen covering got too much bubbles in it couldn't even put it on the screen. The key board protecter is okay it protects the keyboard but makes the keys have a louder noise while clicking. but otherwise ok. doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful with your laptop. but it does a good job at ""surface or basic"" protection."
"on July 19, 2017",Love the case. Keeps the look of my MacBook protected without hiding out. Not this is not a drop proof case
"on February 3, 2018","everything came perfect, when I opened the box I loved the color, and the little plastic keyboard cover was perfect it didn't moved as you type, I already used the screen protector and it was excellent all of my friends asked where did I bought it, the second product that I bought from mosiso and I have no bad comments about mosiso products they are perfect I totally recommend you this and the mosiso products."
"on November 26, 2017","I had the product for about a week or more now and it is great! It is a hard plastic that could break if you are rough when putting it on, but it does protect the computer from the daily use (wear and tear, scratching, etc). It fit perfectly to my MacBook Air 13"". It has some holes at the bottom for ventilation, which is great! However, I don't think this cover will protect the computer from a fall or something more drastic."
"on March 11, 2017",Did not change the looks of my Mac at all and I feel safer when my dog looks up kitty porn. Use protection!
"on June 25, 2017","Nice design, good overall case for macbook pro, fit was perfect and its good to protect your investment."
"on July 21, 2017",This is a well fitted case for a Macbook Air! All of the units are accessible and the case is nice and snug. You can still see the apple when the laptop is on and opened (When it is lit -up). The macbook air i currently have is a foreign one so the keyboard cover doesn't exactly match buts that is okay. the screen protector also fit very well. Not hard to install.
"on July 1, 2017","fits my MacBooK Air, I Love it, Very Nice Key BOARD COVER, I will buy another color soon.Very easy to PUT ON."
"on April 6, 2017",I was a bit hesitant to purchase such an inexpensive case for my first MacBook Air but am absolutely happy with it and the keyboard cover!
"on August 15, 2017","For such a great price I was a little unsure of ordering this product at first; however, I was pleasantly surprised with this case. While I did not use the screen protector, the case fits on easily and keeps the light and streamlined profile of my MacBook Air.While I do not subject my Mac to intense trauma, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their Mac from day-to-day scratches and ding!"
"on December 31, 2016","The case fits perfectly on my MacBook air.The keyboard cover fits well as well. The apple's light on lid is being transmitted very well so it looks so good while the MacBook is on. The only thing I can say about all the set is that because of the color of the keyboard cover which is black, less backlit light is being transmitted through the cover. But still it satisfies.All in all, I strongly suggest this case set"
"on April 3, 2017","Perfect fit, nice color, great price.  I paid $11, my daughter paid $50 for an Apple case just like this, but mine not an Apple case."
"on September 23, 2017",I bought this for my daughter; she absolutely loved it.  It also came with extra rubber feet for the bottom.
"on July 22, 2017","I am so impressed with this. I got the package on the expected delivery date, and everything was nicely packaged. Not only did this purchase include the case, but it also included a silicone keyboard protector and a screen protector. Honestly, if you bought everything separately, it would've cost over $30, but in this purchase, you receive ALL THREE ITEMS for a price of <$15.Would definitely recommend to everyone!"
"on July 10, 2017","Wasn't sure what to do with the little circle pads that came since the case already has corner padding on the bottom but other than that, feels great and looks great. hope it helps protect my MacBook!"
"on November 20, 2017",Fits perfectly and protects almost the entire macbook! I got it for my work computer and don't have to worry about ruining it!
"on August 9, 2017","Amazing laptop case. Screen protector was super easy to put on. The keyboard cover is a bit hard to use, but you get used to it overtime. Overall super happy with my purchase. My laptop took a really bad fall and the case saved it completely. It was from my work table too onto hardwood floor. No cracks in the case and it prevented my laptop from getting any damage! Super happy with this purchase! it's been three months and the case is holding up fantastically."
"on March 22, 2017","I ordered that MacBook Air 13inch clear case and it Came super fast, nothing was cracked the keyboard cover fit perfectly and the screen protector was secured well. The whole set came in perfect packaging with contact info right on the front of the package. Everything was neatly wrapped and they even did a follow up to see if I was satisfied. Would 10\10 buy again even though it seems like this will be lasting me for a while (have already had it for about a month everything still great)"
"on October 1, 2017","Love it! Exactly as advertised! Fit my 13"" MacBook Air perfectly...and the silver matches perfectly! 10/10 would recommend!"
"on September 13, 2017","My daughter ordered 2 of these, one in the red and the other in the tie-dye blue, for her boyfriend and for herself.  Perfect fit and she loves it."
"on October 24, 2017","The case is great to be honest. The color matches with what I ordered, but it’s a bit big for my laptop sometimes the top part will snap off but it’s not something that bothers me. I just snap the top part right back on. The screen protector is also great just makes sure to clean your screen really well before putting it on. For the price you’re paying it’s a pretty awesome product."
"on April 11, 2017","Very nice hard case it comes in separate pieces and snapped on in less than a minute love the keyboard protector also, just lay it on top of the existing keyboard and it stays in place, color torquise is very nice"
"on May 26, 2017","It was delivered faster than expected and in great condition. The package had the hard case, extra case buttons, and a keyboard. All in great condition as well. I am very happy with my purchase!"
"on November 4, 2017",So cute and great quality. I've had it for over a month and they keyboard cover still looks new.
"on February 4, 2017","This is a great product! I had a different laptop case with keyboard covering, and I switched to this brand because the old brand prevented easy typing (it would make the keys stick). This keyboard cover allows me to type at my normal typing speeds and protects the key board from all the dirt it would otherwise be covered in! The case snaps on very easily, and it has protected my laptop while in my backpack. It cleans very easily, and is overall a great purchase for the price!"
"on August 6, 2017","This protection case and keyboard cover is more than I can ask for. Everything fits perfectly and I can still have a nice mac underneath! I recommend, but make sure you get the color you like."
"on November 29, 2016","Love the color of my case! I got the Rose. This is a GREAT price!! I put the screen protector on, it comes with a small cloth to wipe your screen prior to putting on your protector and it also comes with a small squared plastic piece, to slide the bubbles out of the screen.You want peel off the layer that says to peel first, then use your plastic chip to slide any bubbles out, once all the bubbles(or most) are out and your screen protector is firm to your screen, you can then remove the top layer."
"on October 15, 2017",Beautiful color. Nice surface touch and the keyboard cover fits well. Would order again or recommend .
"on April 12, 2017",I love it!! It fits my MacBook Air perfectly and I love that you can still see the apple when the computer is on. It's exactly what I was looking for!
"on October 24, 2017","Good product, good price, fast shipping.  This fit my 2014 MBA perfectly.  I had issues with applying the screen protector, but that's my fault (I'm somewhat of a perfectionist).  Everything was a perfect fit."
"on March 12, 2017",LOVE THIS CASE! i got the marsala red and i love it!!! its matte and protective. the only thing i didn't understand were the little circle stickers for the bottom of the computer. they fit but didn't stick down. but that's okay- i'm just not going to use them 😊 and the screen protector was so easy to put on too! so happy with the product!
"on November 18, 2017",The case for the Mac Air Book perfectly. My daughter loves it and all her friends are now asking their parents for one. And the price was excellent. This is the second one I bought and if I had more Mac Books I would have bought one for each from here.
"on September 7, 2017",Perfect fit for my Apple Air. Easy to wipe clean and keeps my computer from getting scratches.
"on January 30, 2017","I'm very picky about cases for my electronics, and I must say I LOVE this case. It's a nice color and the sleek material is a nice touch. Snaps on and fits perfectly.UPDATE:After having this case for only 2 days, there are several scratches. If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere (which I usually do), be prepared."
"on November 15, 2017",Excellent case.  Holds up much better than my previous Speck case which cracked on all the corners.
"on April 25, 2017","It fit great, wish the keyboard cover was ​sticky. I do not like the screen protector. I could not get it on."
"on April 15, 2017",Rich color comes with keyboard cover and extra pads for the bottom cover. No complaints...
"on May 16, 2017","Mosiso cases are a great product, the quality for the cases are very smooth. Really like all i have bought from this seller. Also it is very thoughtful from them to have the whole case packet with a screen protector as well as keyboard, you dont have to worry about placing separe orders for these products since they are already included with your case purchase. Overall experience is good."
"on January 22, 2018","This is a nice cover, I don't use the keyboard cover but the outside cover has held up nicely and protects the computer well."
"on January 1, 2018",Love this product! It fits our MacBook Air well and wears well.  Great price for this product.
"on December 28, 2017","I love it!!! fit perfectly, beautiful color and great protection for my MacBook.  Keep up the good work you guys are doing... thanks"
"on December 3, 2017",I absolutely love this cover!! They keyboard keys leave a little to be desired but the cover is excellent!!!
"on August 9, 2017","Perfect fit for my MacBook Air 13"" model #1466. Comes with the case, keyboard cover, and screen protector= Great deal! I would purchase from this seller again."
"on September 4, 2017",I love this case. It came just like pictured and displays the apple logo nicely while lit. Will purchase again!! The color is also very accurate!
"on February 7, 2017",This case is awesome - and after having sent back a similar product from another company - I was so relieved at the quality. The light pink I ordered was the perfect tone I wanted (and I've received a lot of compliments on the color!) and when your MacBook is on the apple label shines through the case. The material is matte and soft while still being very protective. And the keyboard cover the case comes with is a major plus! Highly recommend.
"on November 7, 2016",I had initially bought a clear case from a different merchant. I had to return it because it wasn't a CLEAR case. The Mosiso case is clear! I love it! It's durable & it fits nicely on my MacBook Air. This product came in right on time. I recommend buying it this product.
"on January 3, 2017",I bought two of these cases as gifts. The coloring is exactly as shown in the picture. The cases were shipped to me free of damage and arrived promptly. We found that it was very easy to put the cases on. They fit snugly on the laptop and do not interfere with typing or closing the laptop lid. It's a great case for an amazing price. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple case that can protect your laptop from daily wear and tear.
"on August 2, 2017","Love the product. Fits perfect (almost, one of the corners doesn't cover all the way) and love that it came with a keyboard cover (although the letters being in white on baby pink makes it a little hard to see) even with these little flaws I give it 5 stars!"
"on November 13, 2017","I love this case! Fits perfectly, and I feel my keyboard has a defense against crumbs. I wasn't sure what ""chartreuse"" would look like, whether more yellow or green, but it's a very pretty, soft neon green that is peaceful and fun to look at. At least on my Mac, it looks exactly as pictured."
"on September 27, 2017",Restful color and smooth keyboard cover.  Also this arrived within 2 days which I love.
"on July 21, 2017","So far so good. Put this cover on my Macbook Air a few days ago, mainly for protection from drops. It is sleek looking(gold) and the apple shines through when on. the keyboard cover fits perfectly, dims the back light at bit so it is a little hard to see at night. The cover wiggles a little sometimes(not super snug) but all in all a decent cover."
"on August 28, 2017",Bought this for my 13 inch MacBook Air. It was perfect. Very happy with my purchase.
"on May 15, 2017",Absolutely gorgeous product! People are frequently stopping to compliment me on it. The keyboard cover feels very natural. This is actually my second cover purchased from Mosiso but the last was turned in when the computer crashed. I highly recommend and may decide to buy some other colors just for fun!
"on January 18, 2018","The top part of the case was  a little difficult to get on at first- I had the same problem as some other people- only 3 of the 4 'clasps' would snap into place, but just keep working at it and it will eventually snap on! The keyboard cover is okay, it is just a little bit off but overall great purchase!Also I got the black case and you can still see the logo faintly when the laptop is closed."
"on November 25, 2017","I got this case to protect my Mac Book Air. It fitted perfectly. It fit's so well that once in a while people come to me and say that this is their first time seeing a pink Mac Book, lol. I love the keyboard protection. I really do recommend this product."
"on December 31, 2016","With such a great price, you cannot go wrong with this product.  Although the screen protector is tricky and rather difficult to apply, the overall final product received is great!  The wine red color is nice, although slightly less bright than pictured.  Case application was simple and the case easily popped right onto the computer.  Furthermore, I commend the seller for protecting the product during transit, as it arrived wrapped so the pieces would not scratch each other.  Great product for a reasonable price!"
"on December 19, 2016","It is a perfect fit in all senses. However, there is one things to consider with respect to the keyboard cover, it blocks the keyboard light. Why I get to see is the base of the keys, but the letters are not clearly visible, even though the cover gives you the impression they should. It's no problem unless you are in complete darkness but is something that can definitely be improved in the product."
"on March 6, 2017",This is my 2nd case like this. Great product for the price and the colors are true.
"on August 21, 2017","This case is absolutely gorgeous! Feels great, it's light, doesn't feel super plasticky, and the looks exactly like the picture (I got the Serenity Blue color). The apple logo is bright enough that it shows through the case even though there isn't a transparent spot left for it. The keyboard cover fits well and matches the case perfectly. Feels like I have a whole new laptop! Definitely recommend."
"on November 21, 2017","This is a beautiful product, matched only by the lovely people who own this small company. They checked in and were genuinely concerned that I liked the product and that I was able to properly install the cover, sent me a video and relayed old fashioned customer service.  They were wondeful and my laptop feels and looks great!"
"on August 10, 2017","I got the light pink one first for my MacBook but it got dirty so quick and you can tell it was bad quality. I love the transparent one though (I have it on right now, as i am writing this review) Truly amazing and serves its job. And it ships sow quickly, I got it whiting two days or something."
"on January 31, 2018","The case fit perfectly and definitely helps with the daily wear and tear and to keep it from getting too dirty.Great case if you wanna put stickers on! Only ""downside"" is that if you have greasy fingers it may make the slight matte of the case look a lil gross but that's more personal preference."
"on January 28, 2018","Snaps on really easy, looks great, feels durable, lightweight. I didn't use the screen protector. The keyboard cover is really great too! Its like it isn't even there and it feels great knowing crumbs and dog hair won't get under my keys."
"on August 21, 2017","Good case, doesn't appear to scratch the laptop, fits nicely around the MacBook Air 13in (mid 2017). Screen protector is a nice touch, couldn't get mine to go on without bubbles, but you can hardly see any flaws while using the laptop. Keyboard protector is lame, also I'm worried about something pressing against the screen, so I don't use it. Rubber stops on the bottom of the case are nice to make the laptop not slide around"
"on August 27, 2017",I ordered this for my Grandaughter and she hasn't had any issues so far...She is just starting to Nursing School.
"on October 27, 2016",The first cover I bought to protect my Macbook Air from Best Buy disintegrated shortly after I bought it. I immediately placed the Mosiso cover and could see the fit and quality is of much higher quality. I confidently recommend this product.
"on January 9, 2018","Such a soft feel to it.  Easy to pop on and off.  My only complaint is that the keyboard light doesn't shine through the letters, BUT I can still see it in the dark."
"on February 10, 2017","This MacBook Air hard case set is a fantastic value.  It was very easy to install, and even comes with a color coordinated keyboard cover.  The screen protector was not installed, but that was my personal choice.  I already recommended this item to my co-worker, bought the item from Amazon and installed it on her MacBook Pro!  Great purchase.  And as usual, Amazon shipping was impeccable."
"on August 16, 2017",The hard shell cover fit perfectly and snapped onto the Mac easily.  The keyboard cover was also a perfect fit.
"on September 15, 2017",My teenaged granddaughter loves the color and her mom loves the protection!
"on March 21, 2017","I wanted something simple but cute to protect my laptop while it's in my backpack.  This case is perfect!  Love the color, love the way it feels!  I haven't used the screen protector it came with, but the key cover is interesting.  At first I didn't care for how it felt or fit, but I'm beginning to adjust and am still using it.  The case itself is exactly what I wanted."
"on January 28, 2018",This product is very cheap but does not seem like it when it is in use. It is very sturdy and doesn't chip. It also comes with a screen protector and a keyboard cover. The keyboard cover does not stay very well but I only bought this for the case.
"on January 2, 2017",The color of this laptop case is absolutely gorgeous and was exactly what I was looking for. It is a beautiful rose gold color (almost shimmers) that matches the rest of my rose gold items in my office. Laptop cover is heavy duty and protects my laptop well. Also comes with a super cute keyboard cover. The keyboard cover muffles the sound coming from the speakers a little bit but I usually just find a part of it up if it bothers me. Recommend this product!
"on March 1, 2017",Excellent product!  The cover fits perfectly as does the keyboard cover!  Will definitely purchase again!
"on July 26, 2017","I got exactly what I expected. I've had this product for a couple of weeks and haven't experienced anything wrong with it. I have not put my mac to the test, so I can't comment on the durability of the case. The keyboard cover is a little flimsy, but it gets the job done. Once it gets adjusted to the keyboard, it sits just fine on it. Would definitely order another case."
"on April 4, 2017",So many positive responses from everyone who has seen it. Fits perfect. I agree with other reviews that I would like to see the apple logo.
"on July 12, 2017",Excellent case. Comes with screen saver and keyboard cover. I've bought 3 now. Very nice and sturdy!
"on July 20, 2017",Very good case and easy to put on. Makes my laptop look sleek. The screen protector that comes with it also looks great. Takes a little while to put on if you're a perfectionist like me and want to smooth out all of the bubbles but after fit looks like there isn't even a protector on which I like. Very satisfied. Will be ordering another case in a different color.
"on September 27, 2017",Put the cover on backwards at first and it wouldn't close properly. Corrected and it was perfect fit.  A little clarity would have been nice but its an excellent product and the vendor delivered as promised.  Would purchase from them again.
"on May 14, 2017","Wonderful durable cover, keyboard cover and screen protector.  Very happy with my purchase!"
"on August 1, 2017",Perfect fit!  Looks like this will provide lots of extra protection for my MacBook .  Love the color!
"on October 19, 2017",This a nice hard case- it's looks good and is sturdy. Snaps on easily.
"on February 6, 2017",It was nearly impossible to take the case off (I didn't put it right on the first try so I had to take the case off and put it back on) but it seems/feels very sturdy and color (though bit different from the photo) is pretty and it had screen protector as well so that was a plus! The keyboard cover is very very slightly off BUT it is very soft and overall covers keyboard nicely.
"on October 5, 2017",Looks good on the laptop very feminine and clean looking thank you
"on July 17, 2017",Nice
"on February 2, 2017","I'm happy with the quality of the case, the price, the speed of delivery and cannot see paying 3 times as much for a plastic case from the Apple store. I doubt I will use the keyboard cover much because I'm very fast on the keyboard, and felt it slowed me down a little. I think it was moving a tiny bit, not because it didn't fit correctly but because of my production typing."
"on January 17, 2018",The cover fits perfect. No complaints. The keyboard cover is a good compliment to the plastic cover.
"on July 28, 2017",Well worth the money to protect the investment of a Macbook. Feels very solid around your computer. And it does not snap off easily.
"on April 12, 2017","I love changing computer cases, and I had problem with those that had velvety feel to them, bc I was never able to clean them completely. That is not an issue with this one. So beautiful, classy, and different. I love it!"
"on January 23, 2018",I love this case. It fits perfectly and I love the matching keypad cover and screen protector.
"on March 10, 2017","Ordered the case in peacock green--great if you're looking for a dark foresty green. The case came in a plastic packaging and also shrink wrapped so it arrived perfect with no scratches. Looks nice, feels nice, and doesn't add that much weight onto my macbook air. The top will be a little harder to remove than the bottom but at least it fits VERY well. I don't plan on using the screen protector but it came with one. Great for the price~~"
"on August 1, 2017",awesome.. i like it vey much. it fits well with my macbook air well and i got three things for one price...my device is protected now. thanks.
"on January 22, 2017","Love the color and fits perfectly.  It protects my new iMac from scratches - definitely NOT drops, but I got a padded felt sleeve for that. The keyboard protector works well too, although it does leave an imprint on the screen that I have to wipe off occasionally. Overall, very pleased and love the look it gives my computer!  I have not installed the screen protector..."
"on December 7, 2017","everything is fine, I had a hard time putting on the screen protector and could never get the bubbles out even though I followed all the directions. its harder for me to put on because of the size, unlike a cell phone screen protector."
"on February 1, 2017","I love this case! I am very particular about my things as a whole and had high hopes for this case. It met every expectation- durability, style, and finish. It feels smooth to the touch but has enough grip that it isn't slippery. I'll never look for a different case. My husband loves it too and is replacing his flimsier case with one of these. I would recommend to all."
"on November 14, 2017","In my opinion outstanding product, I’d recommend anyone considering buying this product, do it."
"on September 16, 2017",Protects and keeps my Mac visible when laid around my home.
"on December 5, 2017","Great product, super fast shipping.Totally recommend!"
"on November 15, 2016","I am 100% satisfied with the product, shipping, and follow-up. My only concern is that it does hold fingerprints on the material that it's made out of. I'm guessing it's the oils on one's finger. Additionally, it would have be even better if the screen protector was 1 (Private Screen) and 1 (Clear). Other than that, love the product or maybe it's because I'm a MAC product newb."
"on October 15, 2017","This cover worked really well and was easy to install. The screen protector was a little tricky to do but looks great. Some people complain about the keyboard cover, and it does change the responsiveness a bit but you get used to it and it ties into the overall look. Much better to have it than not!"
"on September 2, 2017","Fits nicely, no issues trying to put it on. Love the pink!"
"on February 9, 2017","Best product for the money. Exactly as describe on Amazon. Can't get a better deal for the price. Having bought a similar one at same price a few months ago that ended up in the trash can after a week. I am a real customer. Yes,the keyboard cover gets used to use it but provides real protection. I use it everyday in classroom , cause all my paparrs are on my MacBook Air..... it works ... great customer service as well ..."
"on February 11, 2018",Fits like a glove and not OJ's glove but perfect and good looking too
"on April 11, 2017","Love the Product! Love it so much that I have just ordered another one. The color is amazing, and also the quality, the delivery was really fast."
"on December 4, 2017",The cover works and looks great.  It was easy to install.  The keypad cover is a nice addition.
"on January 8, 2018","It was a little funky at first to get it snapped onto my Mac, but once it was on it’s perfect! Beautiful color, lightweight yet sturdy enough to protect my Mac! Had a great grip feel to it, so it won’t slip out of your hands or slide off your desk. Great purchase! Would definitely purchase again!"
"on December 21, 2017","My wife love it, nothing not to like. She’s very happy."
"on January 9, 2018","Fits my computer, really cute and simple. Quick delivery and I love that it came with a screen protector and keyboard protector for that price."
"on March 13, 2017",first one came in cracked. second one is great. love the color doesn't leave fingerprints
"on June 7, 2017","love this case! It fits perfectly, the color is on point, its smooth and sleek. I also love that it comes with a screen protector and keyboard cover. I can not wait to buy more colors! I get so many compliments on my case!"
"on August 3, 2017",Fit perfectly onto Macbook Air. Daughter loves the color and I love the protection! It is not an otterbox case but enough to protect against scrathes and small dings.
"on March 31, 2017",Love it!  Makes my new MacBook Air look great and protects it also. I don't use the keyboard protector but love the rest
"on June 12, 2017","The case looks really good on my computer, and I love the keyboard cover too. It's a very nice product and I really like it. I got it a while ago and I still use it."
"on September 7, 2017",I love my Mosiso MacBook Pro cover. It is beautiful and even better than my high expectations.
"on March 5, 2017","It's a great product and I love the way it was packaged! Definitely will be making future purchases here. Thank you! I also really liked how a screen protector, duster cleaner, and keyboard protector were also included. This was extremely thoughtful because it's REALLY annoying how you have to remember to buy these things separately, and you guys had EVERYTHING included. Thanks for making my life easier!!!"
"on May 5, 2017","I ordered this case back in February for my Macbook air. The bottom cover fit perfectly, but the top part wasn't quite big enough, and wouldn't latch on correctly. I messaged them and they quickly responded and had a new top cover sent out the next day. The new cover fits perfect. Great communication. Will definitely buy again when I want another case."
"on December 28, 2016","I purchased the peacock green color and I absolutely love it! I originally had some other generic keyboard cover, but the one provided in this set was of way better quality. It's almost as if the keyboard cover doesn't even exist :)As for the hard case, it fits snug and does not come loose at all. The screen protector, in my opinion, is kind of extra."
"on September 22, 2017",Fits perfectly. Good quality product. Would recommend
"on February 8, 2018","The color is beautiful. Includes all four wanted parts (top, bottom, keyboard cover, screen protector) at a great price. However, my daughter was a bit unsure which way the top case snapped into place- there were no directions.  She chose one way and it’s good. Maybe there is no specific front or back? Super fast arrival!"
"on September 3, 2017",Fits perfect and looks like it just belongs on my MacBook Air. LOVE.
"on June 1, 2017","I got this for my son so this is his review. This case is perfect! The color is amazing, and both hard shells fit snug and secure. in addition, I love the keyboard cover. It fits tightly as well, and there is little issues when typing (just to get used to the keyboard cover in general). Have not tried the screen protector, but looks good."
"on October 9, 2017","Let me start off by saying that the case is higher quality than I expected it to be. For a cheap case, I was expecting low quality. I have had it on my MacBook for some time now and it still hasn't broken. The finish on it is amazing, makes the laptop look great, and the included keyboard cover is nice too. I would recommend this to anybody!"
"on October 6, 2017",Easy to put on and like the key pad cover too. Better than expected overall.
"on February 4, 2017",It gets dirty a little bit at the corners and the small sticker pieces at the bottom are falling off. But overall its a good case with such a price.My friend got a case with same price but from a different seller and her case has scattered scratches and kinda broken (she got hers after mine) a month after buying it.I love the color and design.
"on November 6, 2017",Very good quality. Very happy with the color aswell just like the picture. Just be aware the keyboard protector is completely pink and you won’t be able to see the letters at night (so I don’t even use it)
"on August 5, 2017","Seems good, but the proof will be when I try to remove it as the last hard case I had was a nightmare. I wish the keyboard cover was not quite so bright."
"on September 15, 2017","It is so nice! It fit my MacBook Air perfectly! It comes with a keyboard cover which takes some getting used to. It also comes with a screen protector, but the only issue with that is that it is hard to get little air bubbles out from under it, but it doesn't bother me! Totally worth it!"
"on November 12, 2017","This case is awesome. I got the olive green color and it looks even better than expected, I was a little worried it'd come like brownish green but it came in perfect, love it. The case is matte and comes with an great keypad cover which I love and a screen cover which I haven't put on yet. Overall this product is a great buy."
"on March 10, 2017",It looks exactly the way I wanted ito look. Honestly I purchased it for a upcoming birthday present.  I know it will be a hit!
"on January 8, 2018",Easy assembly and fit. Great color & keeps things clean. I will be buying another color too.
"on October 17, 2017",Easy to install and stylish could not be happier
"on January 9, 2018","So far I love this case. I got it in the rose gold color and it looks just like the picture, but luckily has slightly more pink in it than grey. It snapped on easily and the keyboard cover looks very nice. Also comes with a screen protector as a nice bonus. No complaints"
"on April 8, 2017","I was not able to get the screen protector on, but that speaks more to my inability to do such things than the quailty of the product. The case and keyboard protector could not be easier to put on. I highly recommend this product."
"on February 21, 2017",I was skeptical when purchasing this item because I hadinitilly intending to buy a case from Apple themselves. It's a great substitute I really think that I got my money's worth!!!! I just purchased my MacBook Air before purchasing the case and it really helps prevent scratches and such better than most other off brand cases I've purchased in the past
"on November 6, 2017","I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this product, but it was a great buy!  The price was reasonable and the color is beautiful.  It came with the top and bottom portions of the hard case, keyboard cover, screen protector, cloth, and extra rubber “feet” for the bottom of the case."
"on March 8, 2017",Happy with this purchase. Had no issues. Had to figure out which way to install the top part
"on December 21, 2017","Boyfriend loves his new case! The color is great. I do not like the plastic cover, it was not the type that was bubble-free when applying it. Use a credit card and apply the protector very slowly for best results."
"on June 20, 2017",Very nice fit and stays on strong. Also the keyboard cover is a great idea! The bottom has rubber balls that make it very stable on a coffee table. Overall great design and would buy again.
"on May 6, 2017","I purchased this for my MacBook Air 13"". It was a perfect fit and good quality as far as the transparent color and thickness of material. The little nobs that hold on to the edges were very clean and hold on to the computer very tight."
"on December 29, 2016","So great! The keyboard cover fits so seamlessly and doesn't move. Very comfortable to type on and easy to remove and put back on. The cover snaps on and fits perfectly, not to mention the color is gorgeous and smooth and the apple logo shines through. Overall very satisfied. Have yet to put on the screen protector, but I'm sure that works well also."
"on September 26, 2016","I have purchased several types of cases for  the 13"" MacBook Air, and this is by far my favorite. This case was simple to install and only took a few seconds. The color is a periwinkle and is the same blue-lavender that is shown online. The rubberized finish provides a velvet touch feel. I could not be happier with this case and will purchase more like it in the future."
"on November 17, 2017",This item is a gift but I’m pleased with it.
"on August 18, 2017","Fits my MacBook Air perfectly, color is exactly as pictured. Thanks!"
"on January 8, 2018",Fits MacBook Air great and love the color. Like the krybocover also.
"on August 26, 2017","This fits perfectly, it was just what I wanted. You won't regret buying this"
"on September 21, 2016","After trying several cases, many more expensive, this is the one I would recommend. It snaps on snug, but not crazy tight. Top and bottom fit perfectly, with no gaps and all of the openings in the right place. Top and bottom fit well while computer is open or closed. Even the keyboard protector--which is just a nice throw-in--fits and looks good. Very happy with my purchase!"
"on November 29, 2016","Absolutely love this case! It's smooth but tough so I feel my laptop is secure. The color is perfect and I loved the matching keyboard cover. I wasn't able to use the screen protector, though - mostly due to use error (I couldn't get rid of the bubbles).Regardless, this is a great case and I even ordered another in wine red. Highly recommend!"
"on January 22, 2018","Very, very nice and just what my daughter wanted."
"on April 6, 2017","Great product, maybe a bit darker than the picture"
"on January 17, 2018","LOVE my case! I love how it came with the case, keyboard cover, screen protector, and the rubber circles that go on under your case. The feel and look of it is perfect! Would definitely purchase another if this ever breaks!"
"on January 15, 2018",I love my case it's for perfect for my lap top. I love the color..
"on November 27, 2016","I have one for my computer and bought this one for my adult daughter.  Yes, she likes hot pink...  The cover fits very nicely and is easy to put on.  My only comment is this. The key board cover on mine is beginning not to fit as snuggly as when it was brand new.  Not a big deal...but I make not of that one small defect.  Would recommend the product though (and have)."
"on September 16, 2017",Fits well. Great quality. Cannot beat the price!
"on January 17, 2018","I actually didn't even look at the fact that it came with a screen protector and fabric cleaning thing or a cover for the keyboard, so I was very satisfied with that! But if you were expecting these already then good for you for reading the description lol.  It fits my 13 inch mac book air perfectly. Love it :)"
"on May 7, 2017","I love it! Love the color and it is durable. It came with a screen protector, but I took it off because I got frustrated with the air bubbles, but everything else was great. I even came back and bought a purple one as a graduation gift for my sister"
"on March 15, 2017","Great color, fits the computer perfectly! Shipped in timely fashion without any problems!!! 🙌🏻very happy with purchase."
"on April 11, 2017","Looks awesome, works perfectly. Exactly what my niece wanted"
"on March 26, 2017","This case fits perfectly on my 13' MacBook. The color matches my watch and phone case too, and it's a lot thicker than I thought it would be. It's more protective than my previous Spek case that broke easily because it was super thin."
"on April 13, 2017",Fits perfectly and I love the clear case so my MacBook skin can be seen.
"on February 22, 2017",I love this computer cover.  Especially because its pink which is my favorite color.  You can see the apple emblem through it and its so pretty in pink although the color is called rose red.  The keyboard cover is great also as it gives the keyboard color.  This cover doesn't add any weight to the laptop at all.  Its a great product that I plan to purchase again in the future in another color.
"on January 8, 2018","The case is great! The keyboard cover letters are slightly off from the keyboard and makes it look a little fuzzy when backlit but very minor, doesn’t happen with adequate light and to be expected with keyboard cover! Haven’t put the screen protector on yet though! Shipping was fast and I fell much better now that my new computer is protected!"
"on October 30, 2017",Love this case- came on time and exactly like picture. great quality
"on October 4, 2016","I got the serenity blue case, and I absolutely love it! The case looks exactly like the picture, and I love how it comes with a keyboard cover AND a screen protector. The feel of the case is really nice. It has a soft matte touch to it that I love. Plus it doesn't collection to fongerprints. Definitely worth the buy of you're looking for an affordable laptop case!"
"on August 22, 2017","Love it, still get fingerprints on it but was not expecting much more than protection for my laptop."
"on March 24, 2017","Great case, perfect fit, and I love the rose gold color!"
"on November 8, 2017",Great product with excellent freebies!
"on January 11, 2018",I never write these but I have to because this things fits like a glove. I nerve wanted that little keyboard thing but I also like the way it fits and I might use it from time to time. I has a really nice color to it and is translucent enough to where the apple can be seen. I love this thing. I can't wait to add stickers to it.
"on June 2, 2017",Fits the mac book air perfectly! Even came with a screen protector!  Absolutely perfect.  Bought another mac book for the family and will purchase another protector kit from Mosiso. Love it!!
"on October 24, 2017","Love it !  This product is well made and looks great, the key cover gives a great look and helps protect from dirt and liquid. For the price you can by different colors and change your computer looks whenever you want ."
"on January 14, 2018",Beautiful case and keyboard protector. Item just as described. Very happy with product and great price!
"on May 13, 2017",Wonderful cover and love the keyboard cover too!!
"on August 5, 2017","Awesome product and awesome price! Product arrived in excellent condition and fit my mac air 13"" perfectly! I love the light pink against the silver of my laptop, it looks so nice and is well protected. I also love the screen protector and key cover that it comes with! Definitely recommend buying one!"
"on February 4, 2018",Fits my MacBook perfectly. Great color quality too.
"on August 28, 2017",Fits my MacBook Air perfectly. All items were intact as well.
"on April 6, 2017","Good product, picks up oils easily"
"on March 29, 2017",I got both purple and blue and the colors are beautiful and absolutely worth it. I'm glad I got this.
"on August 11, 2017",FITS GREAT LOVE IT WOULD BUY AGAIN
"on February 28, 2017","I was unsure about this case at first, but decided to try it out anyways. It clicked into place super easily, took less then 5 seconds to put on. The keyboard cover is nice. I didn't receive the screen protector, which is fine, I wasn't planning on using it. Overall it's a really great case, and yes, the apple logo does shine through."
"on January 4, 2017","Originally I was thinking that this was going to be a glossy case, but it is Matte and almost has a silicone-esque feel to it. I love it because it doesn't slide around on a table and is very lightweight. It even has ventilation which I need since I am constantly on my laptop. Great purchase, and works just as well as the Speck cases!"
"on September 8, 2017",I love how light the case is. It's so easy to pop on
"on August 10, 2017",I love this case! I had a little problem with getting the screen protector and fit properly but nothing major.  I will definitely  be purchasing this case again.  I ordered from them before when I got my first laptop case in 2015 and it lasted me almost if not 2 years!
"on December 7, 2017","Case and keyboard cover fit my 2017 13 inch MacBook Air perfectly. I ordered the camel and it’s a beautiful, neutral color. The only thing I didn’t like was the screen protector but I think it was more of an applicator error than a flaw in the screen protector itself. Very satisfied with my purchase."
"on February 17, 2017",This is exactly what I was looking for. I love the color and having the keyboard cover is a great perk. it doesn't have any gaps and it covers the keys flawlessly. The only negative thing that I can say about the case that it is hard to get off once it is on. But it's still an awesome buy. I plan on buying this in green in the future
"on September 27, 2017",Love it. The teal is very dark. Almost forest green. Still like it!
"on December 6, 2017",Fit great for new gen Apple air great product made great not cheap feeling
"on February 6, 2018",wife loves this for her macbook
"on March 17, 2017","Best buy thus far for my Mac Air... Easy to wipe off/clean, great quality, and absolutely love the feel of my keyboard. Highly recommended 👍🏽"
"on February 7, 2017","snapped right on, seems like it'll be easy to remove. I had read that others were almost impossible to remove. Like the rubber key pad cover."
"on July 6, 2017",One of the best purchases I've ever made. I love my MacBook like a baby lol and this protects it and makes it look super cute. 3 piece set for cheaper than cheap but it is a great product. Definitely going to buy more colors to change it up for the fall and winter.
"on August 22, 2017",Great product. It fits my Mac with no issues. I Love how it looks! Would order something else again if needed
"on September 7, 2017",Perfect fit and great color.
"on July 19, 2017",Fit perfect. Very satisfied.
"on January 15, 2018",Fits good and really like it
"on September 14, 2017",Excellent product at excellent price!! I would order again!!
"on April 3, 2017",Great green color...popped right on my MacAir and I love it!
"on June 1, 2017",We chose the red design and love it!
"on July 27, 2017",Love it.  Offers great protection for my Mac and the keyboard cover is perfect!
"on January 15, 2017","I purchased this item for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. It's the perfect compliment to her new Mac Book Air she got for Christmas, She especially enjoys the keyboard cover. ""It's like it's not even there"". This product well exceeded both our expectations. Thank you for designing and manufacturing such a high quality product."
"on September 13, 2017","I ordered this in deep teal. It's an unusual color that really stands out. Putting on the cover was a snap, and it's protected my computer from some bumps and dings already. Fashionable and practical!"
"on March 8, 2017",Love the color. Works well.
"on March 13, 2017",For the price its exactly what I wanted
"on May 25, 2017",The color is just like in the pictures.  The cover seems to be durable and was not difficult to place on.  Came with a keyboard protectir and screen protector as well but I did not use the screen protector.
"on December 18, 2017",Great case. It fits perfectly and was easy to install.  A great alternative to the ones that are often sold for far more in the Apple store or at Best Buy.  The keyboard cover is nice and can easily be removed if needed.  For sure would buy this again when i get another Macbook
"on March 27, 2017",This case fits my 13' MacBook Air perfectly. The color is definitely Rose Gold just like my iPhone 7 Plus. I am most impressed with the keyboard cover. It fits over the keys very well. I will definitely purchase this brand again should I decide to change colors.
"on November 30, 2017",I bought it for my granddaughter. She was very happy with it.
"on December 12, 2017",Perfect case for my laptop and it came with everything it said it would!
"on October 15, 2017",It fits like a glove. It's a cute color. Worth the price.
"on August 24, 2016","I think Pink and Grey/Silver go so well together. This purchase has made my MacBook Air look super cute yet elegant. It's a great purchase of three items for a great price. I do have one slight problem with the screen case part, it fits a bit loose, so when I open my laptop, the case almost comes off easily. Other than that, I am a satisfied, happy customer! I recommend it!"
"on May 14, 2017",The item fits well is a great color and great price
"on December 28, 2017",Installation was fairly easy. Fit was good. Seems to be a good product.
"on March 10, 2017","This is a great case! It's smooth to the touch, and will protect my MacBook :-) happy it came bundled with a screen protector, and a key board cover. I'll look forward to getting another, in a different color in the future.Also it's easy to put on, haven't had any problems with it yet."
"on September 6, 2017",Perfect to protect your laptop
"on June 12, 2017",I LOVE THIS HARD CASE COVER WITH KEYBOARD PROTECTION! I want another color! My mentor tried to steal mine but thankful it didn't fit her macbook pro.. i have the macbook air pro. I sent her the link to amazon for this. I hope she buys one soon!
"on August 17, 2017",Quality product. Shipped quickly.
"on December 25, 2017","Got it as a Christmas gift from my mom and it is just perfect! It's better than the prior cases I had before and it came the exact color that I saw online. It attracts a lot of finger prints though, but apart from that i love it."
"on February 7, 2018",Works very well and fits properly on Macbook.
"on May 16, 2017",This case is nicer than I expected. It protects my case and it's looks great. It's easy to install and remove.
"on October 7, 2017",I bought this for my daughter's laptop.  She loves it!
"on January 10, 2018",Lightweight and sturdy
"on May 4, 2017","It's a great case, its very pretty! The only thing I didn't like was the over for the keyboard, but otherwise than that I have no complaints! Its the best deal, and the quality is amazing! Please buy!"
"on August 27, 2017","This bundle was awesome! I got everything I needed to protect my MacBook for $18. The quality is great, can't tell the difference between this case and a speck case. Except I like this case better lol. I got the serenity blue case and I love the color. The keyboard cover looks really cute and fits all the keys perfectly."
"on December 11, 2017",I love this!  I only wish I had ordered one years ago.  the keyboard cover stays in place very well.
"on August 11, 2017",Great product.  Fits perfectly.  Well designed.
"on February 4, 2017","The case fits my MacBook Air perfectly. I also like that the case has some what of a rubbery feel, makes it easier to grab my laptop. The keyboard cover is okay. It comes off of the keyboard easily and makes it a little difficult to type. However, I like the way it looks. Overall great purchase especially for the price!"
"on May 3, 2017",Awesome case fit so good
"on December 24, 2017",Very nice. Great for the price!
"on November 4, 2017",perfect as described!
"on November 20, 2017","Received cover and looks great,  Giving as a gift.  Shipping was promt."
"on January 6, 2017","Great pricepoint! Just received today and the hard shell is a perfect fit. I love how the apple shows through the case. I also like the feel of the keyboard cover. I tried putting on the screen protector but it didn't stick very well. No worries, I'm not as worried about the screen as the body of the computer/keyboard."
"on October 20, 2017",Fits Macbook Air perfectly.  Purchased this color for my wife.
"on September 16, 2017",Highly recommend. I like the soft rubber feel. Easy to put on.
"on October 11, 2017","Good product. I'm very satisfied. Now, MacBook feels more safely :))"
"on July 27, 2017",Great. Worked perfectly
"on December 19, 2016","So far this case and keyboard cover has worked great for me. It does hold finger prints on the case, but I'd much prefer that to them making my computer dirty.  I did not apply the screen protector, so I cannot comment on that part of the purchase. But I am happy with my purchase overall and would buy from them again."
"on February 5, 2018",Great case for MacBook - easy installation along with added perk (free) of the keyboard cover & screen protector. Price is perfect (compared to others sold in the store); one could literally have 2 or 3 colors for the price of one! Also arrived on time (2-day Prime). Highly recommend!
"on August 25, 2017","Case feels nice and solid, color looked even better in person (it's kind of translucent).  Keyboard cover also feels more responsive than you would expect, though you do need to type just a bit harder compared to bare keys.  Overall very pleased with the purchase after the first week."
"on May 27, 2017",Great product.  Does what it needs to.
"on July 21, 2017",Well made and fits perfectly.
"on February 1, 2017","This case fit my MacBook Air 13"" perfectly. It is lightweight and allows the Apple emblem to show through.  The keyboard protector was a nice addition and though I didn't think I would need it, I use it and it works well.  I am very happy not only with my purchase but the service as well.  Would highly recommend."
"on August 22, 2017",This case fits very well. It is exactly the color shown. The keyboard cover fits as well. I have absolutely NO complaints!
"on December 12, 2017",Super beautiful and fits perfect
"on January 21, 2018","Took me so long to find a good macbook case for cheap and i think i found the best of the best. This case is so cute and perfect and it also protects! Mine came with the keyboard cover thing and screen protector and in my opinion, its amazing. I got the kind of blue-ish color and it suits my macbook."
"on February 1, 2017",I loved the case and it is just as advertised. It's smooth and soft to the touch but is still a hard case. It fit perfectly on my 13.3 in MacBook Air and was easy to put on. The only problem with it is that it would most likely not protect my laptop from a fall but it does protect from scratches and finger smudges.
"on July 9, 2017",Got it for the wife. She loves it.
"on January 25, 2018","I wanted to buy a case for my new macbook air but not spend too much money. This case looks great on my computer, fits greats too and didn’t break my bank. Didn’t use the screen protector or keyboard piece, but kept them just in case. Will purchase again."
"on March 27, 2017",excellent product
"on December 9, 2016","Beautiful color! The case fits well and seems to be solid and is so far doing a good job of protecting my computer. The only downside is that a few of the keys on the keyboard cover don't match up perfect, but it's really not even that noticeable. I've gotten a lot of compliments on my new case! Definitely a great deal. Would buy again."
"on July 31, 2017","fits snug, does it's job well."
"on July 19, 2017",Love my case! Gives my computer a little more personality :) Would definitely recommend.
"on February 9, 2018","I love it.. Clicks right on, fits perfectly and the color is exactly what I expected. It comes with screen protecter and keyboard cover.. Will be ordering more in different colors."
"on June 21, 2017","Arrived super fast, in perfect condition.  I love it.  Thank you."
"on May 14, 2017",UPDATE:  Mosiso responded to our initial 1 Star Rating and contacted us to remedy the problem.  They promptly replaced the case and cover which fit perfectly.  THANK YOU for the excellent customer service :)The case did not fit properly; it was too big so we contacted Amazon and they promptly gave us credit.
"on March 12, 2017",Well made and super pretty
"on January 16, 2018",It fits perfectly and the color is so pretty! Highly recommend!
"on October 10, 2016",Really satisfied with this product. Arrived in a timely manner and was securely packaged. Fits my MacBook Air perfectly. I didn't put on the screen protector and you can't see the Apple unless the device is on but that's fine by me. I would most definitely order this product again.
"on September 11, 2017","I didn't think I was going to be receiving a high quality set for such a low price, but this case looks exactly the way it does in the photos, the keyboard cover fits snugly, and the clear protector for the screen was easy to apply and left no bubbles! Beyond pleased with the purchase (and careful packaging)."
"on December 24, 2017",I purchased as a gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Fast shipping and great price!!
"on September 10, 2017",works great
"on November 3, 2017",Fits great!
"on May 13, 2017","I bought thie hard case for my daughter Macbook, she is really happy with this case."
"on December 5, 2017","I love how it includes almost everything you need to prevent any scratches on your laptop. The keyboard cover is soft and every single product that is included in this bundle is what is said in the description. Also, you can still see my stickers on my laptop with the case on."
"on March 16, 2017","I bought this product in the color Camel and it shows minimal to no fingerprints at all! However, I was hoping it would be clear enough for stickers to show clearly, and I don't think that will be possible. It's pretty matte. The apple logo does show through when it's lit up."
"on January 4, 2018","Great case! the keyboard cover is precisely cut and very thin, which makes typing on the laptop enjoyable. The color of this is beautiful and the case itself looks a lot more expensive than it actually is. You really can't beat the quality at this price point!"
"on January 30, 2017",The case is easy to snap on but hard to take off but it's provides good protection to my laptop. The color is vibrant but the only downside is that you can see fingerprints on it. What I didn't know was that it came with a screen protector too.
"on March 12, 2017",fits great
"on March 19, 2017","People here saying it doesn't fit..... there's literally a picture of what model this is for. ""It doesn't fit my MacBook Pro!"" It ain't for a MacBook Pro homie. Anyway 10/10 it's super cute and fits perfectly for my MacBook AIR :) swag"
"on November 10, 2016",I have to say i was a little leery of buying this after reading some of the reviews but for the price i had to get it. It arrived in just one day and it fit perfectly and the color is great. Just MAKE sure you're model number is A1369 or A1466 or it will NOT fit. I'll for sure be buying a few other colors!
"on June 12, 2017","Great case! Great buy! This case was a Mother's Day gift and it included the added bonus of screen protector and keyboard cover. The letters on the keyboard case do not perfectly align with the letters on the keyboard, but that is really no big deal unless you are staring at your keyboard."
"on November 30, 2017",nice fit so far so good
"on December 3, 2017",Love the color and the keyboard cover.
"on February 4, 2018",Love it!
"on October 9, 2017",Very nice.
"on August 10, 2017",I love this case and the color is great. The order was shipped out very quickly and arrived with ease. I have never had a keyboard skin so that will take some getting used to for me. I would definitely order from Mosiso again.
"on January 12, 2018",Love it
"on October 21, 2017",Great fit for the MacBook Air 13!
"on July 18, 2017",Perfect
"on December 29, 2017",Seems a little flimsy at first but after I made sure I snapped the case on in ALL the right places it was good to go! The keyboard jelly is a little cheap in my opinion but overall would buy again
"on April 10, 2017",I love the color. Just purchased this cover it seems to be doing good. Snapped on easily. So so far so good!
"on February 11, 2018",I love it make my life easier
"on October 19, 2017",Love the color. And I like that they gave a screen protector and keypad cover.
"on September 7, 2017","This is my second set and is a gift for my husband.  He really likes it--mine is great too.  A wonderful value, good quality, and arrived so fast.  I highly recommend this product!"
"on May 26, 2017",good
"on January 25, 2017",The cover was very easy to install.  We purchased it to help protect daughters laptop as she studies oversees and she has been very happy with it.
"on October 15, 2017",Good
"on November 30, 2017",It is pretty good overall. It is really hard to get it out from the computer. The keyboard fits perfectly. The only problem is that if your computer has fell and the corners are crooked they will stab into the case so keep that in mind.
"on July 9, 2017",ok
"on September 14, 2017","I have purchased a few of these that were different brands (but identical products). I like this one best, and the value is great since it comes with the keyboard ""condom"" (it keeps stuff from getting in there. lol ) and screen cover."
"on March 14, 2017",I love the case and keyboard protector! Great price for such a good product. I did not use the screen protector. I tried it but there were air bubbles so I ended up taking it off.
"on January 7, 2018","The case has an amazing matte texture. The color looks exactly like it does in the photo. The only small problem is just the rubber keyboard cover. The letters are so light that you can not see the keys themselves. However, other than that I love the hard case and how it represents by personality."
"on June 30, 2017",Excellent!
"on August 14, 2017",I am so excited about my cover! It looks great on my laptop and was very easy to put on. I got the Rose Quartz color and it look very simple yet elegant. I've had my case for about two weeks now and there have been no complications. Good quality and good price. I highly recommend!
"on January 26, 2018",Great case!
"on December 18, 2017",Exactly how the pictures looked. Perfect fit to describe product. Fast shipping.
"on June 29, 2017","Perfect for my Mac  Good quality, sturdy and urable"
"on October 25, 2017",Gave it 5 stars. Wanted to give it 4.5 stars because the Peacock Green color is not as it's vibrantly pictured on line. It's more of a dull pale hunter green. Quality is great. Worth every penny. Hope the seller continues to offer their good value.
"on January 26, 2017",I loved it! I reallly loved how the color looks!! It's exactly how the picture shows. One thing I did which came with this was something to help the screen protector not get bubbles.. because if you're like me you can really screw it up lol. Overall I loved this product especially for the price!
"on July 18, 2017",Good Case for the MacBook. Very effective.
"on January 7, 2018","The first case that I received had a grease mark that could not wipe off. I returned it & it was replaced within two days. The case fits great, it’s slim & works great. I would definitely buy this case again. Great customer service!"
"on August 11, 2017","I love this case. I had a $50 ""good"" brandname one before this that cracked within three months of having it. This one seems to have a little more give (but still protects) and actually looks better!"
"on December 2, 2016","I actually bought two-- one for mine and one for my mom's laptop. The colors were beautiful and vibrant, and it's holding up well, far better than I expected for the price (I purchased the three in one deal). I personally like that the apple logo is not visible until it lights up-- it looks surreal!"
"on July 18, 2017","the case lasted longer than the one that I got from Best Buy, over time the non-slip stickers on the bottom come off, and the corners on the bottom part of the case break off, still able to use, just annoying... time for a new one."
"on June 16, 2017",It is a nice case to protect from scratches. Love the color and fast amazon shipping.
"on February 5, 2017","I'm really happy with this cover. Agree with other reviewers, good quality for price. No issues with screen angle so unsure what other people are complaining about. Purchased the black. Aside from having trouble cleaning a few fingerprints  from it, I recommended it to family and friends, too."
"on March 26, 2017",No issues.  Had to carefully attach bottom case.
"on March 28, 2017",Good job
"on July 15, 2017","I absoloterly love my case. Unlike another case i bought from a previous company, i like that the case snaps into place perfectly & the keyboard cover slips right into place. Only thing i wish it would have came with would be the dust stickers, other than that i love my case!"
"on December 28, 2017","It's good. Especially the keyboard cover. My friend accidentally spilled a drink on my laptop the other day, and the keyboard cover kept it from seeping through the keyboard and into the laptop. The rest of the hard case has been pretty useful in keeping my new Mac from getting any scratches"
"on January 26, 2017","This case turned out to be exactly what I had hoped it would be. The rose quartz color is very pretty and has a matte finish. It comes with the plastic case, a soft keyboard cover, and an adhesive screen protecter. Very good quality. I will purchase this again when I get bored of this color!"
"on January 23, 2018",Looks good. Functions good too. Will buy another for my MacBook
"on March 15, 2017","Excellent value! I love how it makes my computer look stylish and protects it at the same time. Wonderful value for the price and comes with all of the parts. Be careful putting on the screen protector. I ended up with some bubbles, but I should have been paying better attention when I did it. Absolutely love the color selections! Great purchase!"
"on December 11, 2016","Absolutely great case and keyboard cover for such a convenient price! Easy to put on. Very helpful for protecting MacBook from any scratches and dirt; keyboard cover can be easily removed, cleaned from any dust, and placed back on while the keyboard always stays clean. I totally love my order!"
"on January 7, 2018",This case was VERY easy to put on to my MacBook! the color is vibrant and exactly what is pictured. the keyboard cover fits perfectly and the screen protector fits and was easy to apply! over all I'm very happy with the product.
"on March 15, 2017",Love it!!
"on December 20, 2016","Case fits well and the color is beautiful! Snaps on easily, and its nice that this product includes the keyboard cover AND screen protector! Great product for a really good price, I definitely recommend it!"
"on November 29, 2017","I have a MacBook Air and I LOVE this case. Super simple to put on, the clear is so nice because its not obnoxious. I felt the clear color was professional. Love love love!"
"on January 16, 2018",This product is nice and high quality. Recommended
"on January 15, 2018",Love the color (true to what you see on amazon) and it fits perfectly. P.s. the “Apple” logo doesn’t shine as brightly as it appears in the photo but you can see it through the case. Good purchase!
"on July 18, 2017","Fits my MBA great. Camel is a lovely neutral bush as pictured. IMO, this color is closer to a light mauve than camel, which is what I was hoping for. More taupe undertone than beige or pink. Happy."
"on July 25, 2017",Excellent..!!
"on February 1, 2018",Great product working as expected would buy again
"on January 22, 2017","Perfect fit! The color is awesome. True. Fit was perfect. The corners are all covered so I'm not worried about scratches. Over all I am very happy with my purchase. I'd buy it again! The keyboard fit nicely and doesn't put pressure on the screen when closed. I own an iMac airbook 13"""
"on January 30, 2018","I'm so happy I bought this! It's sturdy, and now my keyboard is going to stay clean! Wonderful purchase!"
"on September 18, 2017",simply classic! just as in the picture.
"on May 27, 2017","Great color and material. I bought the light pink one, and super satisfied with it. It's just soooo cute and protects my laptop from scratching!"
"on January 31, 2018",excelente presentación
"on September 2, 2017",Really nice texture and feeling to it. Smooth and soft to the touch. Comes with everything you would need to protect your laptop. Only problem is that it's kinda hard to put on the screen protector. But besides that everything else is simple. Would buy again if I had to
"on October 1, 2017","Plus pointsit protects your keyboard, screen, and the exteriorit increases the life of your laptopMinus pointsreally hard to put the screen protectorIts worth the money"
"on April 5, 2017","Very nice cover for my MacAir. Fits perfect, easy to snap on, and the color is just what I wanted. Very pleased."
"on August 17, 2017",Great case. Good quality and fast service.
"on August 15, 2017",It came with everything! It had wipes to clean the macbook and the keyboard cover as well as a screen protector which I wasn't expecting!! The case is snug and fits the computer great and it isn't too tight that I can't take it off to switch for different colors. Love this case and will buy again!!
"on July 27, 2017",The case looks great
"on June 29, 2017","Came on time. Super durable, but not as see-through as the picture shows. The case is easy to clean and does not 'scuff off' the color like other cases do."
"on June 2, 2017",I've had this case for a couple weeks now and so far I love it! It snapped on perfectly and the color was like what was shown in the picture. Good product!
"on December 17, 2017",I’ve had this cover for about a year now. I’m happy with it. The light color does get a little dirty..
"on December 5, 2017",Love this!
"on December 29, 2017",Cover worked great for my grand daughter.
"on May 22, 2017","Not only is the quality of this product great, but the customer service is also exceptionally amazing. Initially, I bought the Rose Quartz color but it turned out to be a lot pinker than I had imagined/what the picture insisted. However, I reached out to their team and they were more than happy to assist me with my exchange. Great purchase!"
"on August 10, 2017","This case is simply perfect. The color is vibrant and the texture is smooth. I was looking for a computer case that i can put stickers on, so the simple color was perfect and it seems to protect my computer well. The keyboard cover helps keep the keys clean and safe from falling off."
"on February 16, 2018",Love it
"on February 11, 2018","I was worried about the case covering my decal & it did /: but it’s okay because I love the case. The color is just what I was looking for & the keyboard cover is amazing, you can type without any problems."
"on December 23, 2017",It was a bit hard for me to assemble but it snapped in place.
"on December 22, 2017","This is exactly what I wanted.  The cover fits perfectly, and so does the keyboard cover.  I had a Speck before and this one seems comparable.  I would definitely buy this again."
"on July 10, 2017","Great product, excellent value, easy to install, provides full protection while showing your style!"
"on September 13, 2017",Excellent.  Exactly what I was looking for.
"on August 13, 2017",I love the keyboard cover that came with it BUT it does limit the lighting on the background of the keys. The case itself is very smooth and I am enjoying the change from the Speck brand as it feels like the same type of material for half the price.
"on February 8, 2017","Super Great product. Would recommend. Only thing is there was no instructions on how to put it on. Not super hard to figure out, but still would have been nice to do it right. The only complaint I have is since the screen protector had no instructions and I didn't put it on right."
"on January 11, 2018",Works great on my MacBook Air (newest Version). Very easy to install. Looks super. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
"on August 18, 2017",We tried multiple products previously to finding this one.  This product fit perfectly - Thank you
"on March 8, 2017",Just as described!! I love the colors but my favorite is the orange (for my MacBook Pro). Fit just right and no problem with installation.
"on July 12, 2017","ITS FANTASTIC.It doesn't make the MacBook Air super heavy, though it bulks it up ever so slightly.I got the wine red one, and it looks exactly like the photos.It's super easy to slip on too. Totally worth the money."
"on June 12, 2017","Great product, and can't beat the price! I had a small problem with one of the pieces when I first received it, but the costumer service was incredibly prompt and courteous in helping me resolve the issue. Would definitely buy again."
"on August 21, 2017","The case fits my laptop like a glove and it has a soft, almost velvety feel to it, which I like a lot. I also like having the keyboard cover since it's so hard to clean out the Air's keyboard. You just have to type really hard (which I do already)."
"on December 7, 2017","Actually, a very nice cover and for the price, you can't beat it. Would definitely buy this item again !"
"on March 9, 2017",Great Item for the money.  Very easy to put together.  It even comes with a screen protector which I wasn't aware of.  Pretty cool.  I love the color too.  There was a tiny color imperfection but I'll live.
"on May 1, 2017","I love this color and it makes the outside of my computer feel all velvety. Hasn't broken thus far. I don't use the keyboard cover since it muffles the sound on the Air, but that's a-okay."
"on May 14, 2017",Great
"on January 24, 2018",Pretty color & a perfect fit! Very happy with my purchase.
"on November 1, 2016","Solid product, fast delivery, fits like a glove on MacBook Air. Don't hesitate. Just buy it. Keyboard cover lays nicely as well and the included protector and cloth are a bonus. Received nothing for my review. Just a solid product. I've purchased two already just to have more then one color."
"on September 27, 2017",Just what I wanted.  I scratched my laptop really badly on a flight and this covers it up nicely.  Very soft to the touch and more of a quality feel than I expected for the price.
"on September 19, 2017",Great protection and good material. Would recommend this for your Mac .
"on January 10, 2018","The cover and the key protector (?) worked perfectly! Am sooo pleased I ordered this Mosiso cover (after I had ordered another company's similar product, which did not work well at all!)."
"on August 24, 2017","Good and sturdy case! It snaps on and stays on. You can still see the apple logo when it's on and the rose gold color is true to the image. I like the keyboard cover it comes with, for the most part it lines up with the letters and fits perfectly. Thanks!"
"on March 13, 2017",Love this case-super easy to snap on and it looks really great.
"on March 13, 2017",I'm impressed with the sturdiness of this cover. And I'm very happy that the keyboard cover fits snuggly over the keys. I didn't use the screen protector as I'm not one to use them.
"on January 11, 2017","love it, love the color and the way it feels. great item for  great price"
"on November 15, 2017","These are great, they really last! The first one I ordered in Aug 2015 and my daughter uses her laptop for college plus social media day and night."
"on March 24, 2017",Great product.  Fits and looks great on my mac.  The keyboard is made of thick plastic and fit snugly.  Highly recommend it.
"on December 16, 2017",Very solid product. Great
"on October 14, 2017",works great nice fit.
"on November 22, 2017","Great product- smooth but still durable.Color Camel- I was worried it would come in looking more brown than pink but its actually a tad bit on the pinker side, regardless I think it is beautiful.It has happened once where I had to relock the case back into place."
"on August 10, 2017",Purchased the covers for my twinny college bound granddaughters.  They are happy with the covers and that's what counts!
"on November 6, 2016",So far this case is working great! It goes on very easily and fits well.  I don't really use the keyboard skin but when I did it also fit well and the keys lined up. I have not used the screen protector because I feel like it is unnecessary for a laptop but I'm sure it works just fine.
"on October 20, 2017",Nice as pictured
"on July 14, 2017","Really a good case! protects well, feels nice and blue color looks poppin!)"
"on February 9, 2017","This case fits and works very well. Could use more ""clips"" for a tighter fit but the computer also is pretty thin and that limits the amount of places to clip to. All in all for $13 this works great. Color is a little lighter than pictured, still looks good though."
"on February 8, 2018",Love my new cover Looks awesome
"on July 6, 2017","It fits great and love the keyboard cover and screen protector that comes with it! Normally, I don't like screen protectors because I like to pick/peel them off but I can't even notice it's there!"
"on August 20, 2017",This is exactly what I need to protect my mac.  Really like it.  The keyboard is very soft and smooth.The color is not exactly the same between the keyboard and the cover.  It is acceptable.
"on January 21, 2018","Every part fit well. I did have  trouble applying the screen protector, but I really only cared about the outside case ad keyboard cover"
"on January 25, 2018",This thing is so awesome! Loved it so much I bought another
"on February 11, 2018","I never write reviews but felt compelled to after receiving this product. After spending hundreds in cases from Best Buy that never failed to break, this affordable case has been the best, sturdiest thing I have ever used! Customer service was great too. Highly recommend."
"on December 16, 2017"," I personally love solid colors , I find them sooooo cute , basic and sleek . This is my second Mosiso product .. I first got the red one and now the olive green . I received plenty of compliments, I would definetely recommend ."
"on March 13, 2017",Everything fits exactly as it should on my 13 inch MacBook Air. For some reason I never put the screen protectors on right but this one went on perfectly and I can't even tell it's on there now. This brand is great quality at a great price!
"on September 28, 2017",I absolutely love this hard case. It's a little on the pinker side but overall it is a great product for the price I paid. I would definitely recommend it.
"on October 25, 2017","I really like the casing, it's smooth but not slippery. The keyboard cover is also great for protecting your keyboard from food, liquid, dust what have you. very satified with the product so far."
"on October 12, 2017",Perfect
"on April 17, 2017","Outstanding product, I just got my first MacBook Air in my entire life. I need only the best case for the entire outside, the keyboard, and screen. Thanks to Mosiso, I was able to get them all for a low price."
"on November 8, 2017",I absolutely love it. Does the job of scratching my laptop and helps it look so cute! I really love this product
"on October 17, 2017",I love this cover set for my Mac! The color is very vibrant and it keeps everything clean!
"on November 24, 2017",This case is protective and I get many compliments on the color.
"on June 13, 2017","I got Marsala red for my new MacBook Air. So pretty, seems durable. Very pleased. Didn't use screen cover but really like the keyboard cover."
"on September 14, 2017",She loves it.
"on July 24, 2017","It fit perfectly and the I love the color. Wasn't looking for a key board protector but now that I have it, I like it."
"on March 22, 2017","This case is one of the best that I have ever purchased on Amazon thus far. Not to mention, it's very inexpensive compared to other cases. The Camel color is really nice and the keyboard cover fits perfectly."
"on July 3, 2017",She Loves it so their you go lol
"on January 11, 2018",Super cute!
"on May 6, 2017","I bought this in the rose quartz color and I absolutely love it,It is the most complete product you can found and the price is awesome, it protects my computer, the keyboard and the screen!Love it"
"on October 26, 2017",Case fit great on my laptop....
"on January 23, 2017",This case fit perfectly and is a cool color just barely translucent enough for the logo to glow through.  Screen protector was of surprising quality and went on easy.  I didn't think I would care for the keyboard cover but even that is a fun addition and works great.
"on December 15, 2016","I love this case! The color is as described, and the product as a whole exceeded my expectations.My laptop looks so pretty now :)When I contacted Mosiso, their response was quick and their service representative was very friendly.5/5 would recommend!"
"on December 11, 2017",Very good makbook cover. I like it very much. It is good price too
"on December 30, 2016",Nice enough to protect from scratches and nicks. Not for someone who like to toss laptops around
"on July 18, 2017","The case fits perfectly and doesn't feel cheap at all, my only complain is the rubber feet but they include extra ones just in case. Overall an excellent product."
"on September 24, 2017","Good for the price you pay. Basic protection if you want to keep your MacBook Air looking new when you want to pass it on or sell it. Came with a cover for everything, even the keyboard. Packaging looked cheap but the product inside makes up for it."
"on July 10, 2017","I love this case so much! Its pink, but delicate soft pink. I always get compliments on it. I also use the keyboard protection and it matches perfectly. Definitely going to repurchase in the taupe color!"
"on April 3, 2017","I really liked this case and keyboard cover. The screen protector tho wasn't really that great, I ended up taking it off and tossing it."
"on January 24, 2018",This cover fits perfectly my mac book air 13”
"on March 28, 2017","Came quickly, color is amazing, fits perfect!"
"on May 10, 2017","however, it does snap very easily and the little grips on the bottom case fall off easily too. There are little snaps that help keep the case on the bottom, but they are right where your wrists are while typing so they scratch you. it can be very annoying. but overall i love the case."
"on May 13, 2017",The case is amazing!!! I bought one for myself and then bought one for my cousin too. We both love it.
"on January 19, 2018",Just bought a new computer and this case looks super awesome on my computer I love the color
"on December 23, 2017",Love the color
"on April 28, 2017",SO PRETTY!
"on July 26, 2017",You're getting a lot for the money here. Fits as described and looks great on my nieces first MacBook Air for college.
"on January 10, 2018","This was a great value. My teen daughter loves how it looks and protects her Macbbook. I had originally purchased one for a lot more money at Best Buy, but she didn’t like it and ordered this one. We saved money and got something she liked better."
"on March 22, 2017","I love it! The color is exactly as advertised and easy to put on. The keyboard cover fits snugly. The screen protector however, is a bit tricky. Though even after several attempts, the adhesive remained sticky. Great product! Definitely recommend!"
"on August 13, 2017",Bought for my daughter. She loves it!
"on October 24, 2017",Awesome Case for an unbeatable price.
"on April 3, 2017","I bought this for my daughter's new laptop and she loves it.  It fits well, was easy to install and the color is matches the picture."
"on February 21, 2017",I bought this for my mom and she loves this case for her laptop. It was nice that it came with a screen protector too. The case that I bought for my own laptop was from someone else and it's already breaking down ... I plan to buy another one from this person.
"on November 1, 2016",Got this for my girlfriend she loves it
"on April 10, 2017",Product is fine
"on October 11, 2017",Great case. Looks sleek and provides adequate protection against falls and spills.
"on September 13, 2017",Excellent case! I love that it also comes with screen and keyboard protectors. It's very smooth and sleek and I love it!
"on October 10, 2017","Product was just as listed on the site and my daughter loves the color and the fact that the apple logo shows through the case perfectly. I would definitely purchase again, maybe in another color to change them out."
"on January 17, 2018","Very simple, love the color, easy to put on the laptop. Overall great product and worth the price!"
"on May 13, 2017","Awesome product really nice, the edge of the cover on side is a little jagged but still like it."
"on September 16, 2016","I absolutely love the color and texture of this case. It is like your typical plastic case for that Mac's but it has a matte/rubbery finish to it. We will see how long it lasts. They all tend to break easily because they are plastic. For the price of this whole package, I am pleased."
"on March 30, 2017","It fit my laptop perfect. It just snaps on! You can see the ""apple"" through the case when the laptop is on. I wasn't sure if I should use the keyboard cover but I did and I like it. Great price at $13.99!"
"on November 5, 2017","I ordered this product for my work laptop. The case and keyboard cover arrived promptly, fit well, and look nice. I am considering buying an additional keyboard cover from the same company for my personal laptop."
"on August 10, 2017",This is a GREAT case and it is so nice and it will definitely protect her new computer while in college!!  Great quality and glad we found it!!
"on December 28, 2017",I have had this case for over a year and it is still going strong the only thing is one of the corners chipped but I do use my laptop a lot for school and other things but not noticeable would highly recomend this product you won’t regret the purchase
"on September 23, 2017",I love this case!  It keeps my computer safe and clean!
"on September 1, 2017","Case is great, provides a nice outer shell that withstands a decent amount of a beating. Would recommend this for those who need a light case for travel. Fits perfectly"
"on October 14, 2017","All I have to say is how happy I am!! I had previously purchased a key protector and it was awful ... When this one came in with my cover (that I LOVE) I wasn't going give it a chance but it felt different, so I did and I am so happy I did!!  Amazing :) !!!"
"on January 17, 2018","This exceeding all of my expectations!!! I bought this for my teenage son's computer. The color is great, I love the hard shell covering. The carrying case is helpful since it is in his backpack everyday. The small case for the cords is also a great bonus.."
"on December 28, 2016","So cute!  Exceeded my expectations.  Case snaps on easily, fits snugly.  Color is cute.  Keyboard cover also fits perfectly.  Color is also cute.  Ordered along with Soya microfiber leather sleeve in rose gold. Color matches perfectly.  Great day of internet shopping, lol!"
"on September 11, 2017",Very cute! True to color and fit. Have not had any problems.
"on September 12, 2017",I bought two of this and as always I depended on previous reviews and yes they came to be pretty good buys. The colors were nice.
"on January 11, 2018",super cute! the fit is the slightest bit off but ya girl can live with that I ain't droppin my mac all over the joint anyway
"on February 13, 2017",This is my second purchase through this company and I am just as pleased as the first. The case is great quality for the price. It lasts much longer than other cases I have purchased in the past that would plastic would break. But this one is durable and affordable. The color is also true to the photo.
"on February 28, 2017","Product works as expected! The keyboard cover is a little hard to get used to typing on, as it is not as smooth as the bare keys, but it keeps my super MacBook clean!!"
"on January 26, 2018",I bought this case in black for my MacBook Air model A1466 and it fits like a glove. I love the look and feel of the Product. It is exactly as described. Color and quality is as expected as well.
"on February 27, 2017",Great case with the price
"on November 28, 2017",I like this case and this brand. The second case I've purchased through them ​and will repurchase when needed as well as would recommend this brand of case to others.
"on October 31, 2017",Had mine for a few months but now the little side hooks that attach to the keyboard side of the MacBook broke off...
"on January 9, 2018",This product came on ime and was very easy to do. The only thing is that the cover isn’t completely smooth it has a couple little tiny tiny bumps that are almost pointy but don’t hurt but anyway this is such a good product.
"on December 8, 2017",It really nice and it was easy to put on. I love the color and when picking it up it doesn't fall off like my other one I had.
"on February 3, 2018",Nice cover for the price.  Fits perfectly.

"on August 29, 2017",Excellent fit & wuality
"on September 19, 2017","I got the color ""camel"" and its a really pretty mauve/nude color. The case is matte and very soft which i love! There is a small stain on the side which isn't really noticeable so i don't mind but overall i love the color and it's a great case!"
"on February 5, 2017","I love both my products from this brand . I've gotten so many compliments on them . This case and cover really protects my computer from dust and the case installs very perfectly ,smoothly and easily . Haven't had any issues whatsoever. I also love their color options ; might buy more just to switch it up sometimes"
"on July 22, 2017",Looks awesome on my MAC!
"on August 26, 2017",Perfect fit and color for my 2016 MacBook Air! So happy with my purchase
"on December 19, 2017",Really fast shipping! Great product! Purchased this to replace the $50 case I bought that had broke and I could not be happier with the quality of the Mosiso. Especially love the colored keyboard cover as an added bonus!
"on September 25, 2017",Great fit and beautiful color matched the photo on the website.
"on July 31, 2017",Fit perfectly and looks amazing on my Mac Air. It may not be the most heavy duty case out there but for such a great price I will replace as needed.
"on November 16, 2016","Great value.  The keyboard cover is pretty but gets dirty a little too quickly for me and also messes with my typing a little.  The cover is a little darker than what I expected but it fits great and seems to be of high quality.  Overall, a well-made product."
"on August 12, 2017","The case it's self is super nice! Worth the price for that and then screen protector! However, not a fan of the keyboard skin. Doesn't stay on and kinda of cheap but it's okay for me! Maybe it's because mine is clear? Still recommend!"
"on October 9, 2017",My daughter loves it
"on April 17, 2017","I had purchased the same cover, but when I put Mac Book, it cracked. I gave it another go and I'm glad i did. This is a good fit for my computer. I got the silver one, so it doesn't  look like there is a cover. I don't have to worry about scratches. I am completely satisfied."
"on January 17, 2017","This package arrived in great time and was all nice and new when I got it. Just like the pics, fits very well. The only thing is to watch out for dust getting trapped behind the screen protector. Otherwise 10/10 for quality and price I'd recommend"
"on November 18, 2016",:)
"on October 24, 2017",Purchased this for my sons Apple Computer.  Needed to get a quality hard case-delivered quickly...am thrilled with the case and it’s timely delivery.  Would recommend without hesitation.
"on May 15, 2017","Absolutely love this case! As a first time Mac user, I wanted something that was durable and fashionable. I will definitely purchase another case from Mosiso (I have my next color picked out already!)"
"on August 11, 2017",I am 100% satisfied. It came exactly on time and the material feels really good quality. Everything fit and works perfect. I will absolutely order again!  Love it. The price is incredible good for this good quality. Thanks guys!!!
"on October 7, 2017","Right on, fits perfectly, good product."
"on February 22, 2017",Purchased this for my boyfriend's computer and he loves it! It fits really well and the keyboard cover is the best one I've ever seen - it's like typing on real keys. When it comes time for me to buy a new cover for myself I will be coming here!
"on October 11, 2017",Nice
"on June 24, 2017",Very good product

"on November 10, 2017",Awesome case! Love the color. I got forest green.
"on February 6, 2018",This decorative shell allows me to easily identify my MAC next to the others in our household.  The keyboard cover grips firmly on the keyboard without sliding or moving.
"on February 12, 2018",Color is great and feels really durable. So far so good.
"on January 6, 2018","This was exactly what my 14 year old daughter wanted for her Macbook Air and it was perfect!! We did not use the keyboard cover just because she did not want to. BUT if she wanted to, it would have been perfect as well! Thanks!"
"on January 2, 2018","Love this set. I wish the screen protector had come with sticker hinges or something to keep it in place while applying, but it turned out ok even though it's not perfectly centered."
"on September 11, 2017",It attached perfect to my laptop and love to cover the keyboard!
"on February 6, 2018",The case fit my 13.3 MacBook Air perfectly.  Screen protector and keyboard cover fit as well.

"on November 27, 2017",love this! super light and great color!
"on May 14, 2017","It's a great case; easy to put on and seems to maintain its hold well. I love the color options and the fact that I gave give the case a quick clean. The screen protector is serious, once installed, it can be tricky to remove."
"on March 31, 2017","So far, so good! I have a MacBook Air 13. The case was very easy to snap on. The Keyboard fits well. It's nice that it comes with a screen protector because it seems that most cases do not. This is a great deal. It looks nice!"
"on September 24, 2017","I didn't love the color of the first one I ordered, so I returned it and ordered a different colored one and had the new one in no time! The entire process was quick and great! It comes packaged very nicely and has been a great cover so far!"
"on January 14, 2017",Very good product! Fits completely snug without putting anything in a bind!  I actually like the cover for the key pad a lot better than I thought I would and the screen saver was an added bonus! I feel this was a great purchase for the money.
"on May 17, 2017","I love this case! It was true to the color and the keyboard cover fits perfectly. When I first opened the package and saw the case, I thought the color was way off but once I actually put it on my computer it was exactly the same as in the picture. It snapped on and hasn't come loose. Great case!"
"on December 27, 2017",I love it. It’s super easy to put on and the color is beautiful. When typing it’s super softGreat product will buy again
"on March 17, 2017",Nice for the price. I like the keyboard cover
"on January 24, 2018",Perfect Nude color!
"on July 19, 2017",such a cute color and quality. the keyboard cover is hard to type with but it just takes time to get adjusted to it. also you cannot see the apple logo unless your Mac is turned on
"on April 5, 2017",Case is very nice. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice as it is to be honest since it was only $13. I ordered the product on a Thursday evening and received it Saturday before noon. Would definitely recommend this product!!
"on December 30, 2016",This case is amazing. I'm obsessed with the color! It's such a pretty baby pink. It came with a little pad for the keyboard too which is wonderful at keeping it clean. I would absolutely recommend this.

"on March 9, 2017",Good fit and great price.
"on October 25, 2017","The cover has a beautiful color(Rose Quartz) and the keyboard case fit very well. I like that they sent extra dots (the white, rubbery circle that is under the case that is for traction) because I tend to lose one or two. More styles would be cool."
"on July 27, 2017","Great product for the price and timely delivery.  Exactly as described, plus the plastic is pretty flexible too.  Fit perfectly on my MacBook Air :)"
"on July 25, 2017","Sleek and stylish, I may order another in a different color!"
"on January 7, 2018","Case fits perfectly. I got the burgundy color and it looks exactly as advertised. I didnt plan on using the keyboard cover, but I gave it a try and it didnt feel uncomfortable at all. All in all, a great purchase!"
"on February 28, 2017","The case is amazing!! Keyboard cover prevents from getting dirty the actual keyboard. One thing thats bothers me is that the case is getting dirty easily, i barely touch the back but it gets oily and it's hard to remove."
"on January 26, 2018","Just what I was looking for! The color, design, and assembly was spot on. Shipping was fast and the product came as described. The cover fits perfectly on my Macbook Air 13 inch."
"on January 9, 2018",I love my laptop case. It looks exactly how it does in the pictures. I will order more!
"on January 30, 2018",My husband loves this case! It feels like such high quality. The case and keyboard cover match perfectly. Super happy with this order!
"on October 24, 2017",I have been through several Kuzy covers and the bottom back clips rose on every one. This Mosiso case fits much better and so far nothing has cracked. Also liked the fact that the key cover was included and matched the cover very well.
"on January 28, 2018",Liked the color choices and ease to install
"on September 19, 2016",My goddaughter loved her gift I had sent to her. Thank You!!!
"on January 25, 2018","looks super cute, i like the color, i ordered the pink one, the cover is soft and it fit perfect."
"on August 31, 2017","Arrived earlier than expected. Beautiful color. If I am nit picking, I am not too keen on the ""Mosiso"" logo being on the space bar, but again that is only if I am truly looking for something to hate about this quality product."
"on March 11, 2017","Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It fits the iMac air perfectly. Not only does it protect it, the color makes it unique."
"on February 4, 2018","The case arrived very fast. The case looks beautiful over my 13 inch Macbook Air, it comes with good quality, two snap-on laptop covers, a screen protector and a clear keyboard cover also."
"on March 28, 2017","This is a really nice case, easy to install.  Love the keyboard protection!"
"on February 26, 2017",The covers for the laptop and keyboard fit perfectly and are beautiful. The cover for the screen not so much. I can't get rid of the bubbles. But I was mainly interested in the protection for the outside and am happy with this cover.
"on December 12, 2016","Great product, looks great! The best part though, was the customer service. I had a problem with my order. Without giving too many details, the company went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I was satisfied. Above and beyond. Great company."

"on September 10, 2017",Work well and priced reasonably

"on March 28, 2017","Fits MacBook Air perfectly. The color is also great...received so many compliments. I applied screen protector, no air bubbles surprisingly because I can't apply a screen protector for the life of me."
"on December 24, 2017","Cannot beat it for the price. The case snaps into place perfectly and holds a solid fit. I ordered mine in black and think it looks very sharp, especially with the black key board cover"
"on February 27, 2017","The case, keyboard skin, and screen protector work perfectly. I love all the different color options and the price. Great deal. The key bored skin is so nice, it doesn't interfere with typing at all like other kinds."

"on September 6, 2016","Loved the color of the case, as well as the texture. Easy to put on as well as the screen protector and the key board protector. Only thing is that the bottom part of the case is a tiny bit loose at the corners, but other than that, would highly recommend."
"on September 6, 2017","Color is beautiful, the screen protector was easy to put on, the keyboard cover is really great too. I haven't had any issues with the product, though as with laptop case would do it does restrict air flow a bit more but not enough to cause over heating."
"on January 13, 2017",Couldn't believe how wonderful this product is. The perfect cover and the price is so good. You will not be disappointed and the  rose gold color is beautiful. Very happy. I'm actually about to buy another one for my have other daughter.

"on March 30, 2017",I love it.  I purchased it for my new Mac air 13'.  I expected it to have a little bit of bulk but really it added the minimalist amount and my Mac is just as small as when I purchased it.  Fits snuggly and perfectly so I am beyond happy with the product.

"on August 1, 2017",Works and the keyboard cover is a perfect fit.
"on April 8, 2017",Lovely matte green. The green is a little more saturated in real life than compared to the picture but still a great cover nonetheless.
"on December 31, 2017",I have had this item for about a month now and it really helps to protect my heavily used laptop from nicks and scratches. I also love having a keyboard cover that matches and helps keep dirt from sticking on the keyboard.
"on January 23, 2017","I was pleased with this purchase. The case does exactly what I need it to without any fancy extras and without being too bulky. It allows me to keep the light, air-y feel of my Mac and the quality of the material is great!"

"on February 19, 2017","Fits the MacBook perfectly. The color is definitely a little on the wine shade of red, versus firetruck red, but it looks great. Our daughter took off with the keyboard cover and uses it to pretend to being on a computer."
"on March 8, 2017",Fit like a glove and easy to install
"on January 7, 2018","The case came exactly as it is in the picture, the only thing was that when putting on the bottom part, a part on a corner part snapped but it was barely noticeable. Overall it is great quality and great color!!"

"on February 6, 2018",Very nicely made. Beautiful color. Comes with keyboard mask and screen protector. Easy to mount and easy to clean. Really like it!

"on September 7, 2016","I absolutely love this case and keyboard cover for my Macbook Air, A1466 model! The wine red color is matte on the case and then slightly lighter for the keyboard cover. The Apple logo shows through the cover, so it isn't entirely opaque."
"on January 25, 2017","Love the case. Makes the Apple ""light logo"" glow a little darker and looks nice (stealth mode). I didn't realize it came with a screen protector or a rubber key board cover. Fantastic deal for the money."

"on November 15, 2016",It was not fully packaged however it was perfect. Size. weight not an issue. I was worried about how much weight it would add and increase in bulk.  However there is not issue what-so-ever with that. Still sleek and still lightweight.

"on March 13, 2017","Did not attempt to use the screen cover. Keyboard cover makes it difficult to type... but I am a habitual key pounder, so this just forces me to not do that. The color Is MORE GORGEOUS than I expected though, and I trust that my Air is protected."

"on October 21, 2016","Gorgeous, subtle color - almost a nude. I've gotten tons of compliments. The keyboard cover is a tiny bit hard to type with, but it protects the keys great and if I need to type out something longer I just pull it off."

"on September 7, 2017",Works great

"on February 3, 2017","FINALLY! I've tried Speck(red is definitely not red), Kuzy(keyboard cover kept sliding around everywhere) and iBenzer(My friend had one and it was great. I'm not sure why but mine didn't fit and the keyboard keys were off which was really annoying.) So I guess you can say I've been picky while choosing a case. I needed to love it as much as I loved my computer.I chose the ""camel"" color. I was hoping for just the tiniest bit more of a pink tint to it but I really do love the color. It's very classy looking. I also love the soft, matte feeling to it. The only thing is, it was extremely hard to get the case on but I guess that is better than it sliding off all of the time.This case (especially for the price!) is exactly what I was hoping for."

The color is amazing and it fits really well onto my laptop. It was easy to snap on and the keyboard cover matches up perfectly. However, the letters and symbols are filled in with white so I can't see the keyboard lights through it. I don't mind too much though. This is case is very smooth and durable. I've recieved many compliments on it already! Would highly recommend this as a gift to yourself or someone else! It's great quality for the price too."

"on March 7, 2017","1.  I got the order in 2 days as advertised with prime shipping.2.  Packing was standard -  in a large package ""soft"" envelope.  I would recommend maybe at least using a cardboard box lined with bubble wrap.  Soft pkg was lined with bubble wrap.  The current set up can lead to a broken case during postal handling.3.  Easy to assemble and more than I expected (the protective screen and wipe cloth).4.  The keyboard cover did have small imperfections but they are not significant for me to care about (nothing in life is perfect).5.  Most difficult part of assembly was putting the protective screen.  Only bc I hate bubbles, finger prints etc.  The protector did have advisory tags on them letting you know when to remove-thus limiting dust etc from sticking to the protective film.Overall great experience (thus far)."

"on October 15, 2016","I dont rarely make amazon reviews, and Ive been using this service for awhile, i just buy and  leave it at that.Because there are others already doing reviews. But I had to come and say that this product was one of my best purchases on Amazon. Everything was perfect. The case is absolutely how I wanted it to be. I thought that this was too good to be true because, it came with a screen protector, keyboard cover, as well. But everything works. With the keyboard cover, if you lift your laptop and flip it upside down, it might slide off. And that is the only time it does that. Obviously you are getting this for the black cover which is the best i think on Amazon.. So yea this was for my first ever mac laptop, and this purchase is one I am really satisfied with."

"on December 11, 2016","I ordered the Mint Green version and I'm very happy with it thus far.  It seems like a high quality product. But time will be the true test for this product but so far so good. It came with the 3 components as advertised: 1) Hard case, 2) Keyboard cover and 3) Screen Protector.1) Hard Case:The color is a soothing zen like matte Mint  finish (silky not shiny plastic). It was a perfect fit for my Air 13. The case is translucent so that Apple shines through clearly when the computer is on. Very easy to install the case. I haven't tried removing it yet but I don't think removing it will be a problem based on how easily it was to install and based on youtube videos I watched. Some people have complained in general that these cases are magnets for finger prints...I haven't noticed this to be the case so far but even so I'm not terribly concerned about finger prints. I'm more concerned about preventing scratches from normal use.2) Keyboard Cover:The keyboard cover is a similar mint green color similar to the cover...thankfully (not the bright obnoxious green I've seen with some of the competitors mint green covers). The keyboard cover fits like a glove....so good  in fact that if you didn't know better you wouldn't know it was there from a fit perspective except for the fact that the keys are mint color rather than black. It does dim the backlighting of the keyboard somewhat but the light still shines through so its not a problem. I think the covers are a good investment as it prevents finger oils from accumulating on the keyboard, block crumbs/sand etc from getting into the keyboard cracks and it would also protect the keyboard from accidental liquid spills. (I once dumped half a bowl of my cereal on my keyboard....wish I had a keyboard cover on that computer).3) Screen Protector:I haven't tried to install the screen protector on the screen but I do use it to prevent the keyboard cover from coming in contact with the keyboard cover...I hear that keyboard covers in general can leave temporary marks on the screen that you'd have to clean...so I just lay the screen protector on top of the keyboard cover when I close the screen to prevent that from happening.Overall I'm very happy with the product and I would recommend it...especially if you are looking for a keyboard cover as buying these two items individually will cost more.  Time will tell if this product is worthy of my 5 stars. My expectation is that the product will last at least 3 years with normal use (e.g., no drops)...anything less than that and I'll be disappointed and will re-calibrate my rating.Hope this helps."

"on September 16, 2016","Rating 4.5/5I purchased Marsala red. At first glance, the case is a beautiful color. No cracks or broken edges. It came with the case, keyboard cover, screen protector and extra rubber feet for the bottom of the case. The case itself is a nice mate finish with a beautiful color that resembles the picture. It was easy to put on but a little too easy. The top cover doesn't feel secure on making me think it will easily pop off if I drop my laptop. The top is also a bit heavy and makes my screen fall back at certain angles, though it's not a huge issue. The bottom piece feels nice and secure. The extra rubber feet feel a bit different than the feet already on the case, making me assume you can switch them out according to your personal preference. Lastly the keyboard cover fits perfectly but feels a bit odd to type on so I might not even use it."

"on March 15, 2017","I have had my MacBook Air for several years (and is still the best laptop ever) BUT I had literally worn off several of the keys so they were unrecognizable. I needed a quick fix. In addition, I don't usually eat while ""computing"" but somehow the keyboard gets dusty, grimy, etc.so I was in need of a easy fix. While looking through Amazon the other day I ran across several keyboard covers (wasn't considering a case) and of course there are lots out there but when I saw the Mosiso product and the very reasonable price I thought - why not! I am not disappointed. The ease of ""applying"" the keyboard cover and snapping on the hard case could not be easier. On top of that, my concerns about ""type-ability"" were quickly laid to rest. It not only types at the same pressure as before, the soft touch makes it very easy to use. What a bargain!"
"on December 26, 2016",Nice set
"on December 28, 2016",Perfect!
"on September 5, 2016",👍
"on September 30, 2016","The package arrived faster than I expected.  Packaging was nice and keep the content safe.  The materials seems flexible but hard, I like it.  Love the color of Rose gold, the bottom and cover of the case work with a simple click and the keyboard cover fit nicely.  It does give you kind of funny bubble feeling to your finger tips, I am sure it will adjust soon. The best bonus is it comes with a screen protector which was not expected but superb!  I am lack of skill to applying it smoothly, so there are few bubbles that I can't get rid off (I just received my new Macbook Air, so the screen is perfectly clean!)  It is the best case I received so far, I've ordered one from a different supplier for my son's Macbook Pro...couple years ago.  He didn't like the color and was disappointing..made funny clicking noise when you closing the case, so I am consider getting him a new set from Mosiso. I might also order Mosiso's matching Rose God color sleeve to replace my black one.  Very much Recommended!"
"on February 18, 2017",This was a great cover and great for the price point.  I placed this on a Macbook Air that I wanted to sell locally on Craiglists.  My Macbook Air had dings on the corners and light scratches on the screen which the cover alleviated.  The key cover is also a lot better than ones I have test.  I enjoyed typing with it and it was comfortable.  Other covers that I've bought for my Macbook Pro are really jelly feeling and don't seem to match with the keys.
"on September 27, 2017","Pleasantly surprised and happy with this purchase. Not sure what I was expecting, but for the price...could not be happier. Wasn't sure at first...but once you snap on the protective shell, screen cover and keypad cover, it's a total bargain. I would have paid double for this at Best Buy or similar."
"on March 4, 2017","Love this product!  This is the second case I have purchased and I only purchased the second one because I wanted a new color.  I don't use the keypad protector because it inhibits my ability to type quickly, but the case itself is a bargain. It's durable, sleek, and a product I would recommend to anyone who is looking to protect their investment. Highly recommended!"
"on September 22, 2016","I purchased this with my own money, I was not paid or giving this item for free for a review. First off I love this case. It's a beautiful shimmering rose gold. It matches my iPhone 6s plus in rose gold. It comes with a matching keyboard and the text are aligned perfectly. It comes with a screen protector. I like how the seller package each peice of the case separate so it arrived with out any scratches. My only con is this covers up the apple icon. You can still see it light up but if it had a cut out that would have been even better in my opinion. I still give this 5 stars because it wasn't advertised with a cut out for the apple icon. I recommend buying from seller this product was a great price."
"on November 22, 2016",It fits great! Thanks!
"on October 18, 2016",I love how the case looks great not too much of a fan for the keyboard cover though but thats not a big deal because its a rubber cover so i dont expect it to be too similar to the hard keyboard button. But in all I love it.
"on March 31, 2017","I love the color of the case! It's so easy to apply and makes the computer look very unique, although it is just a cover."
"on September 16, 2016",Nice!
"on August 10, 2016",I love this case. It is very smooth to the touch and it was very easy to snap on.
"on February 16, 2017",The color is exactly as pictured & everything fits perfectly! I love it!
"on March 28, 2017","Nice case, color is same as pictured"
"on September 25, 2016","I love my case. The red is what I wanted and it has a smooth & soft touch that makes me love it more. One thing about it though is that it shows the grease marks and then that could look very messy so if you want it to stay clean, you would have to be consistent with wiping it. The keyboard case looks very nice when I put it on but not too long ago I noticed that the letters don't quite match up to the ones on the MacBook, but that's perfectly fine because you wouldn't be able to tell. Also one of my letters were scratched at the bottom but not to the point where I couldn't tell what it is. Overall, if I were to order another plain case I would definitely choose Mosiso, I like it."
"on December 2, 2016","I'm giving it 5 stars because for the price, it's absolutely perfect. When you're paying $14 (less tax & shipping if you don't use prime) I don't see much room to complain. It is just as I hoped for.The ShellAlthough mine did not come with directions, the installation of the shell was fair simple. The shell fits pretty nicely as well. The shell does feel a tad bit cheap but again, you can't expect super high quality practice for the price.  At first, during the installation I didn't know if the top half of the shell was completely on but it was.Keyboard CoverThe keyboard cover fits very snug. Actually, if you want to remove it, it fits so snug that it's a little tricky to get off which I guess means it is going to serve it's purpose.Screen ProtectorI didn't install the screen protector because a. I'm deathly afraid of air bubbles that I always get when installing a screen protector on my iPhone b. There's little direction as to how to install the screen protector c. This is the only true con I found but the screen protector I received did not completely cover the screen. It my just be a personal thing, but it would annoy me knowing that it does not go completely to the edges of the screen. And by screen I mean the desktop, not the entire top half of the laptop.OverallLike I said, for the price it is perfect. With simple installation and a sleek look, I have really no reason to give this anything less than a five star. If there was a four and half star option I'd probably go with that but there isn't so I'll give them the benefit of doubt."
"on January 27, 2017","I tried another case that was about this price, but it did not fit perfect. There was a slight space between the case and the apple logo, so the apple logo shined fuzzy. This one fit perfect! Plus it comes with screen protector and a keyboard cover! Im using all of these (case, screen protector, and keyboard cover) and they fit perfect with good quality! Durable! Clean and fashionable. Love it!"
"on November 6, 2017","I've got no complaints so far. This case is a lot thinner than the Speck one I bought at Best Buy a few weeks ago and ended up returning. The camel color is a really nice warm beige and the case itself hold onto my Macbook really well. It's opaque enough that it completely covers up a sticker that I had on the cover but you can still see the Apple light when the computer is awake. The keyboard cover that came with it is a lot better than some that I've had, but I haven't tried the screen protector yet. Also the package came with a small baggie containing 4 extra white feet in case the ones on the bottom fall off. My roommate's dog has stepped all over the top of this case while I've had the Mac closed and it handled that fine.UPDATE:I've had this case for about 6 weeks now, and I still think its held up great. One of the little white feet fell off, but I just stuck one of the replacements on it and that one has held on find. I also keep my mac in a zippered pouch when I put it in my bookbag, so I'm sure that has helped reduce the amount of wear it gets, but the case hasn't gotten any cracks or shown any real signs of wear yet. I also finally put the screen protector on it, and I like it too. I took me a few tries but I finally got it to where there's only 1 or 2 small bubbles, and you can't even see the bubbles when the screen is on."
"on September 1, 2016","Just got my package today! Everything came in the box brand new, wrapped and sealed. The keyboard cover is nice and I love the texture. Easy to type. I've purchased other generic keyboard covers and some of them make it hard to type. This one so far is nice. The package also came with a screen protector. And the case is hard cover with a really pretty rose gold color. I am really liking it so far. Hopefully it lasts! The case fits perfectly on my MacBook Air 13"". See pictures for an accurate look of the color- I got rose gold"
"on January 30, 2017","I love this product , got it in Rose Quartz  - it looks and feel good. But I just wanted to encourage everyone to check their enter key before purchasing because it didn't exactly align with mine (I have early 2014 MacBook air bought in Europe) :D"
"on March 27, 2017","I really like this case. The color I chose is not something I'd typically choose but it's nice. Think I'll get pale pink next time. I don't think this case will salvage your laptop if you drop it but I do know that it keeps it pretty clean and protected from scratches, which is why I ordered it to begin with. It's so cute and super easy to snap on + I love the keyboard. I'm not the most gentle person so we will see how it holds up. I read some of the reviews before purchasing and some people claim it just snapped as soon as they put the case on. I will definitely update in about a month or so. Great product, cute and came in one day!! Ordered it at 8pm and received it 9am the next morning, amazing!!Update 4/25/17 - love the case, it's perfect and cat proof! I have 3 kittens I am currently fostering & they love to jump all over my laptop and bite the case everywhere. Suppose I'll post another update soon!"
"on July 5, 2017","So I had gotten the color in camel and I love the soft touch to the case Fits perfectly it does come with a screen protector I haven't used that as of yet but everything is great. I would definitely recommend to anybody.Update** 10/7/17Over the course of having my cover on It has lasted for a while, the only default that I have to encounter was the fact the placemat for my keyboard keeps lifting between the keys just by taking it off and on doesn't help much but it stays for a second then lifts again, And the fact the bottom rubber white pieces are completely gone not sure where they are now but they are gone somewhere.. Majority of the time my cover for my screen comes off unexpectedly since the left side clip came off but it still manages to stay and snap back into place.  The color is still great when I first got it. No dullness whats so ever.. the Screen Protector I still haven't used but I will get to that eventually.​"
"on September 27, 2017","Easy to install (and remove).  Great color.  Still thin and light.  No interference at the attachment points.  I chose the rose color and it is very pretty, and not obnoxiously bright or juvenile.  It has a thicker opaqueness, but I still but a decal around my apple logo and you can see it through the case. The screen protector is durable and fairly easy to install (typical screen protection install...yes, there will be bubbles if you install hastily, but they will go away over time and are not distracting).  Personally, I have used this type of keyboard cover before, so I was used to it.  It just lays on tops of the keys and can move ever so slightly, but it really isn't distracting and so much better than loads of dust or crumbs (thanks to the toddler grabs) that would otherwise get in there.  It is also easily removable for people who don't want to have any adhesion to the keys.  Realistically, you could remove and replace at every use if it was really that bothersome to you.  Let's be honest too, this really isn't that expensive so for the complaints that say the keys rub off, firstly, I haven't had that issue at all in my first month, and if it does become a problem in the future, I can replace or remove.  I really love the bundle and that I didn't have to piecemeal the protection for my MacBook."
"on February 9, 2017","Mosiso Plastic Hard Case with Keyboard Cover with Screen Protector for MacBook Air 13 inch (Model: A1369 and A1466), Wine RedThis case deserves five stars! It is perfect for anyone who is in need of a laptop case that is durable and protective as well as stylish and trendy!ColorThe wine red option of this case is spot on; it is just as pictured. The deep red/burgundy matte is a perfect shade and it is even better that the Apple logo shows through. The case color and the keyboard color match so they make a great set. Another nice thing about this case is that it comes in a variety of colors; if you are not a huge fan of the wine red, you could go with a nice gray, purple, or blue.FitI have the Model A1466 and this case fits perfectly on it. It easily snapped into place and continues to stay on my laptop without wiggling. The product surrounds the connection ports, like the USB, but does not cover them. There have been no problems with the case becoming looser as time goes on, so it holds it’s shape well. I would advise that you check the models that this specific case is designed for to avoid any problems with fit. This case is designed for model A1369 and A1466. You can find your laptop’s model number on the bottom side of your Mac.DurabilityThis case is durable and holds up well to everyday life. I have had it for two months so far and it has no scratches. I am a college student, and like most college students, I need a laptop case that will be able to withstand a lot, like constantly moving it from room to room and in and out of my bag.PriceFor only $13.99, I was worried about the quality of the case, but it is above average. The good quality of the case makes the price irresistible, especially because the package includes several extras like a screen protector, cloth, and keyboard cover. That being said, if you are looking for a laptop with good quality and a good price, this is the one for you.Overall, I would say this is a great product that is durable, reasonably priced, has a nice fit, and a stylish color. If you are looking for a laptop case that can keep up with your day to day activities and not have a ton of wear and tear, this is the one for you."
"on January 21, 2018","For the price you get more that what you pay for. I love the cover. Its soft plastic that gives your mac a comfortable feel. The keyboard cover is a great touch to my my macbook air and I love the way the keys feel when I type. The only issue I have is how much the keyboard cover dims the back light keyboard. I have to turn up the keyboard brightness to 100% to see the keys in the dark. The lettering only glows slightly, i just wish it was a bit more clear so the light will shine through. I may eventually change the keypad cover with something else, but for the most part it is a great cover and it feels nice. Typing is quiet on my macbook air with the keyboard cover.The screen protector I attempted to use on my screen but It was difficult to apply. I ended up having so many bubbles i just pulled off the protector and trashed it. I dont think its absolutely necessary to have but its a nice addition to the package as a whole If you can apply it properly.I gave product 5 starts for good pricing, quality and content."
"on March 11, 2017","I love this case! Great value for the money. I have a 13"" MacAir so I followed the instructions to choose the right numbers and it fits perfectly. I love the color. It's a nice nude color that leans towards blush. Probably couldn't stand up to a hard fall because it is plastic, but I haven't had any issues with cracking. I keep mine out and use a soft laptop sleeve for when I travel and it's held up beautifully. Very happy with this purchase and I'm already looking at other colors."
"on September 4, 2017","I LOVE THIS CASE! I just bought a MacBook Air (13 inches). It snapped on easily, arrived quickly and without damage, and the keyboard cover looks great. It's not off from the keyboard lettering at all, and doesn't hide too much of the back lightning! You also can see the apple logo very clearly on the laptop when it's lit up.  It's super easy to keep clean and it looks very fashionable. I have a rose gold apple watch and a rose gold iPhone, and this set is the perfect color to match. Will buy again."
"on January 28, 2017","I bought the camel color; it is a cross between blush pink and a true khaki color. Everything works perfectly and aligned and snapped on well. I previously had a Speck case that cracked and broke at the corners, I'm hoping this one holds up better. I like the matte look and feel of this case better than the slick Speck case. I wasn't sure I was going to use the screen protector (I've had my Mac for almost two years with no damage) or the keyboard, but gave them both a try and am very pleased with how both look and feel."
"on December 3, 2016",I love the simple one color it is. I wasn't expecting the silicone keypad 😱
"on June 25, 2017","I love the laptop case! What a great price for the quality of product you get! I ordered this with one day shipping late at night and it still came early the next day. The case itself was a smooth, rubbery plastic which feels very nice and durable. The color I got was Serenity Blue and I have to say that it is exactly what it looks like in the picture (a blue with a purplish hue). The other reviews are right that the apple sign doesn't show through the case when the computer is shut off, but really who cares? XD The case is exactly what i expected it to be and the keyboard cover was a cute little touch. All the letters were perfectly aligned on mine and it really doesn't feel drastically different than the actual keyboard (and hey, if you don't like the keyboard cover it is easily removable). I'm really too scared to try to apply the screen protector so I cannot review the quality of that but I do have to say that the bundle was an amazing deal, it came super quick, and the product was of good quality. One thing was sort of weird, however, on the keyboard cover. The power button has an icon for the DVD opener (I'm guessing they don't make separate covers for the Macbook Air & the Macbook Pro) so the power button looks weird when it's lit up, but it really doesn't bother me. Other than that weird fluke, I am completely satisfied!!"
"on August 23, 2017","Just snapped this case on to my new MacBook Air 13.3"". I had no issues putting this on, it snapped on nice and smooth, it didn't need to be harshly pushed on either, just a slight press down on the tabs and it was on. The keyboard cover basically sets on perfectly as well, I've read in some reviews that folks had to really work to line it up just right but I don't understand that because the keys are indented on the underside of this cover so it basically just lays right on perfectly. It is kind of weird feeling though, it will take some getting use to having the keyboard cover on but I like it, no yucky stuff getting down in between the keys. The keyboard cover does not stick to anything, it just lays on the keys so if you're rough with your keyboard it may lift up in various areas. This case and keyboard cover came with a screen protector, but it is not big enough for the screen so I won't use it. Not sure why it's too small but it is! I'm not convinced that this case would necessarily protect my mac should it fall, but I do think it would take the brunt of a drop for sure, it's pretty sturdy for being as sleek as it is. If you're buying those solely for protection though I would look elsewhere. I bought the rose gold and the actual case is very true to the picture on amazon. You can see the apple light up through the top of the case as well, it does not have an opening for that, I really don't care about that but some folks like the apple to have a cut out in the case. I put an apple sticker on the case anyway though. This is a very nice case for the money. I like it."
"on January 18, 2018",Fit on my 13 inch macbook air and I love the color. Its thin and lightweight but I just bought it to protect from scratches. I really loved the keyboard cover I like that it matches the case color. Maybe thats the girly side of me color coordination made me happy. I had a similar case previously bit it got oily probably from hand lotion but it caused the case to be discolored. This case you can just wipe it off without issue and your cover wont look oily.
"on August 10, 2017","This case is perfect in color and fit, and you can see the Apple logo through the cover. The keyboard cover also fits well. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. Compared to the Speck cover at Best Buy for $50, this is a great alternative for a fraction of the price. My only complaint is that there was a small defect on the top cover.UPDATE: I notified the seller of the defect and they sent me another top to replace the defective one. The replacement had a crack and they immediately sent another top, which was not the correct item top for my laptop. They sent another replacement case and it's perfect. Their customer service is very responsive and very helpful. Beyond the minor issues I experienced, I think it's a very nice product and I am very happy with my purchase. I changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars based on the whole experience."
"on September 29, 2017","The perfect and cheap case for a MacBook Air. It was super easy to install and really easy to take off without damaging the laptop itself in case you want to replace or change for a new case. I needed a case just to protect against scratches but it sure looks really good with the matte royal blue color. It feels good to the touch and the case gives off this blue lighting through the apple logo on the back which makes it look really cool. I added a decal sticker to make it more stylish. The case already comes with rubber bottoms but they give you four spares just in case the bottom rubbers wore out which is super nice! I wasn't sure about the keyboard cover at first but I grew to like it very quickly. I like the soft texture of the cover and plus, it'll protect it and keep the keyboards clean from greasy fingers.Now, for the screen protector... I've never been good with putting them on, especially the plastic ones, which this is what it is. It will protect your screen but I can never successfully put one on without air bubbles from dust. It created this electric charge when I tried to apply it when I pulled off the tabs and ATTRACTED the dust onto it. It would've been easier if it was glass but overall, I'm happy with what I got."
"on September 12, 2017","I chose this case to keep the shine on a well-used but well-maintained 2011 MacBook Air that I inherited. For the paces I put it through, this case does the job admirably. The mint green I ordered is true to the picture and very pretty, although the material picks up fingerprints. My laptop easily snapped right in. The bottom is not completely sealed, but I appreciate that my laptop doesn't heat up in it. The keyboard cover bubbled when first put on, but has relaxed into the keys with use. It does obscure the backlighting quite a bit (which matters to me because I used it mostly at night). I didn't apply the screen protector, but it lined up well in a fit test. So far, I'm pleased with the appearance, function, and quality of this case. I would buy it again."
"on October 11, 2016",Fits nice and feels nice. Color is adorable.
"on August 9, 2017","Case seems to be great quality. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it comes with four replacement rubber circles for the bottom of the case, which I'm sure will come in very handy at some point.I had no problems attaching the screen protector, which is great. I just wish there were instructions for everything, as I was a little unsure what to do first. But it was no big deal. Tip: it helps to attach the screen protector with an extra person to help. If one person takes the top of the screen and one person takes the bottom, you can each use a credit card to slowly put the screen protector on, avoiding bubbles. It worked perfectly for me!"
"on November 11, 2017","I purchased the Mosiso case to replace one that cracked after a number of years of use. I had no trouble installing the case and it not only protects my mac but also provides a less slippery surface than the mac absent a cover. I did not install the screen protector; I don't really need it. However, I am using the keyboard cover and surprisingly, it is an excellent fit and I can barely tell it's covering the keys. As much as I like the silver color of my macbook air, the black cover looks professional and the apply logo shines through when the clamshell is open. I would recommend this case."
"on May 28, 2017","I searched for so long to find a cook case for my macbook that got somewhat decent reviews. The bad ones scarde me but I went with it anyway. I got the case and it came with extra rubber bottom nubs and the case snapped on perfectly. The bottom lip didn't want to snap over on one side below my keyboard so I contacted the company and they were eager to help. They ended up sending me a new bottom cover for no charge! The new bottom cover fits perfectly and snaps on snug! Looks good on my laptop. I got the mint color and the keyboard cover is cute to, have yet to put on my screen protector!  Good company would buy from again!  :)"
"on October 2, 2017","Very pleased with this case. It fits comfortably over my 13.3"" MacBook Air; it's easy to snap on and take off without worry of damaging either the case or the laptop. One of my biggest concerns was that the case would buckle when I open the MacBook all the way, but I'm happy to report that it doesn't buckle at all. The keyboard cover is nice as well. I can't say how the screen protector works because I decided against applying it.I'm happy with the cover as i bought it to protect the laptop against scratches, keeps the letters on the keys from fading, and keeps dust out of the keyboard."
"on February 22, 2017","I am very happy with this cover.  It arrived earlier than expected and it was as shown in the picture.  Love the green color and how it fits my MackBook Air perfectly. I am still getting used to the keyboard cover, but I am using it just because it looks nice.  However, not all the characters/letters from the cover are aligned with the actual keyboard (you can see that some characters are slightly shifted), but this did not bother me.  You can either avoid using the keyboard cover or just shut off the keyboard light (F5; like I did) and now it is perfect! Can't beat the price!Did not use the screen protector because, I am terrible with those and absolutely hate bubbles/air pockets on it."
"on May 12, 2017","Wow, I am really impressed with this bundle. The case is the exact color pictured and fits perfectly I purchased the marsal red, its more of a maroon to me, but then again I don't know ehh marsal red really looks like! The screen cover is the best part in my opinion, It went on pretty easily and only had to work out a few bubbles but once they were gone I peeled off the top layer and the protector looks exactly the same as the screen. The keyboard cover fits perfectly, I personally don't like them because they get funny after awhile but it does fit great. This bundle is great for the price."
"on June 30, 2017","This case fits my daughter's MacBook Air 13"" very well. It snapped into place easily and holds the laptop securely. There are cut outs in the right places on the sides to allow access to all of the different ports. The matching keyboard protector also fits well and looks great. I like the fact that the case also came with a screen protector. This is a very simple solid color case, but the apple shows through when it is lit. My daughter picked this one right away when she saw that the ""Airy Blue"" is the same as her favorite color.... ""Carolina Blue"". (She is a huge UNC Tarheels fan, of course)."
"on April 10, 2017","I had previously bought a different brand case for my MAC.  It didn't last very long so when I found this different brand on Amazon, I was glad to give it a try.  I am very satisfied with it.  It seems to be very sturdy and looks great!UPDATE:  After only a couple months, it cracked.  I asked for replacement but we had gone on vacation and before I could return it, my return request expired!  I could find no way to contact the seller so it was never returned or replaced.  Now, the cover doesn't even stay on.  It is basically worthless and a waste of $.  I know it was inexpensive, but I expected it to last somewhat longer.  The silicone keyboard cover is great though - no problems with that at all..."
"on July 27, 2016","We ordered this 3 in 1 protector for my sons computer and got it at a great discount. At first he was not a fan of putting something over the key board but as soon as he put everything on he loved it. It fits really good and does not feel lose or too big at all. It really protects the computer pretty good. My son is not very gentle with his computer so I really wanted to get a nice case for him just in case he drops it or something. So far the case has really held up and looks really nice on the computer still. It came packaged really well and was not damaged or scratched up at all when it arrived. It was in a nice size box as well as a nice plastic wrap to keep it all together and keep it from sliding all around. Once we opened it, it felt very light weight and exactly what we were wanting. I did not want something really heavy and bulky like most cases are. A lot of cases you find are super expensive too so I was really happy with this one. I love that there are other colors to choose from as well. We chose Black because it matches pretty much anything and I knew my son would not complain about it. This 3 in 1 is excellent and I highly recommend it to other parents out there looking for something their kids will actually keep on. It has held up great and looks really nice on. I will be buying more in the future for my computer as well. Well worth the 5 star rating. Thanks."
"on March 9, 2017","After reading the mixed reviews on here, I was slightly worried. A lot of the really good reviews were from people who received a discount or got this item for free. I can assure you, this is a 100% real review from someone who has not received any discount or gotten this case for free.The case fits perfectly. It does add on a very slight weight to the laptop, but not very much. The keyboard cover lines up surprisingly well, and the screen cover is really nice. The color looks exactly like it does in the photo.My only issue that I've had is that the keyboard cover causes me to have to type a tiny bit harder than usual, so I'm not sure if I'll keep it on or not. I just type very quickly and don't like to press down on the keys very much.Overall, it's a great product. I highly recommend it."
"on January 6, 2017","It certainly is for those who use their mac lightly, if you drop things often maybe it's not the right choice. But for me and my needs, it's spot on. Easy assembly. No complaints here. Love the feel of the material."
"on January 5, 2018","This item is perfect for what I needed! It comes with a set of top cover, bottom cover, and keyboard protector (all in the matching color!) as well as a clear screen protector. I eventually opted to not use the keyboard protector as I found it to be more of a hindrance to my typing. However, the great price is still worth the purchase for the external covers and screen protectors. Don't think twice - just decide on which color(s) you like best!"
"on April 10, 2017","Bought this one to protect my new Macbook Air and this fits perfectly i love how this case was package well to protect the product will definitely recommend this case easy to install, it came with a plastic screen and a keyboard cover too with the case so worth the price and helps me get peace of mind that my laptop will be protected from unnecessary things to happen,. i just wish that this is a 1 case plastic cover because it has a tendency to fall out specially the top case but other than that i am pretty happy plus the price is good."
"on October 1, 2017","I purchased this for my macbook air. I loved the Color!! I also liked the fact that the keyboard cover reduces the noise when I type. This is convenient since I use my macbook in class. Overall the case is pretty sturdy. It was also very easy to clip on. It also came with a screen protector, however I chose not to put it on."
"on January 21, 2017","5 STARS. Best price I have seen on Amazon for a case like this. The case itself feels sturdy and a little bendy, which I see as a good indicator it won't break if I drop my laptop (which is still better than my laptop breaking though of course.) The keyboard cover fits great, and is easier to type on than any other keyboard cover I've tried this far. Note that a Best Buy tech told me that Macs ventilate through their keyboard so I don't recommend using it if you're pulling an all nighter on your laptop or something. The screen cover was tricky to put on, but comes with a cloth to clean the screen and a mini credit card thing to smooth it out. The package also comes with four extra feet as shown in picture, in case the feet that are already on the bottom of the shell get lost or damanged. No complaints here. Great color too, and yes the Apple shows through the case as shown in pictures."
"on July 29, 2016","I absolutely love the feel of this case for macbook. It is very soft almost feels just like silicone, I love this because I was so used to the hard plastic cases years ago and that was just awful because if you put the laptop on a table it would be slippery, with this texture it makes it stay put.This case fit my macbook perfectly and it looks so nice!The only con I will say is that I am not a fan of keyboard protectors, to me it is harder to type with them on and this goes for every single keyboard cover I have used, I just am not a fan of them. I will say they are perfect for if you leave your laptop open or if you have a wireless keyboard to cover the keys up so dust doesn't accumulate in them or even if you have the apple desktop and you want to add a little jazz to your office room, putting a colored keyboard protector on it will look super nice.I received this product free or at a discount price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.** [...].

"on February 1, 2017","I ordered with amazon prime so the package arrived very quickly. The texture of the case and the keyboard protector is very smooth and the color is slightly brighter than what is shown on here. The case is solid and not transparent at all which was exactly what I was looking for. The only thing that shows through is the light of the apple logo. The bottom part of the case has round rubber pieces to go over the ones on the actual laptop, and they generously included four replacements which i really liked (other cases i've ordered gave me foam pieces with no replacements which became dirty and fell of easily, so i really appreciated this). The rubber pieces are thick and of good quality. The screen protector went on easily (I used a credit card to smooth out bubbles). In the package there was a very thin cloth wipe to dust of my screen with which was greatly appreciate. The only thing was that the row of buttons above the number keys on my Macbook didn't all match with the ones on the keyboard protector, so i suggest you compare the photos of the keyboard protector here to the keys on your laptop before your order. Overall, I'm very satisfied and have ordered another case for my other Macbook."
"on December 16, 2016","The case, screen protector and keyboard cover combo is awesome! The case is durable and does not scratch easily. The keyboard cover lines up well with the keys and is easy to clean. The screen protector was not easy to get on, but I also have problems putting protectors on my 6 in Samsung. Once I got it on, it has stayed in place and is keeping my screen clean. But most importantly, the rose gold color is gorgeous! Really sleek and more professional than my old neon green case :-)ADDITION 3/13/17: So it's been a few months and maybe I'm too clumsy, but this case is not cutting it. The rubber pieces that are on bottom part have been falling off, which is OK I guess since they provided 4 additional ones. But the case has also cracked in various places, mostly importantly by the ""clips"" has almost completely cracked and fallen off."
"on February 26, 2017","I love everything about this product. My favorite color is turquoise and the color is fairly true to what is posted online. Not to mention the price is good and it comes with extras such as a screen protector and keyboard cover. Some people complained about it cracking, which seems reasonable given it's a hard case meant more for aesthetics as opposed to something along the lines of an Otter Box that is meant to be mishandled and absorb shock. The only negative thing I have to say about the product is that the keyboard cover is pretty but not very functional. If you use your computer to type frequently you're better off not using the cover. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to order this again if necessary."

"on March 23, 2017","Cute case! I just got a new MacBook Air and wanted a new case to go with it, so I hopped on my husbands prime account and searched through hundreds of cases before finally deciding that I love the simple blushy pink. The screen protector is a nice addition. However, it doesn't come with the vinyl sticker strips that allow you to remove any accidental dust particles during the application process. Every screen protector I've bought for any product has come with dust-removing stickers but this one. I just used regular tape this time around. Great product though! Make sure you're purchasing the right case for your MacBook model :)"
"on May 15, 2017","I love this! I bought this as a replacement to my iBenzer case (which fell apart as soon as I put it on my laptop) and this Mosio one is far superior! It is much more sturdey than the iBenzer case I had, and the keyboard cover is nicely fitted to the keys--unlike my old one which was rasied, not flat, and was off center. The only thing strange is the fact that te power button also has an eject button. But it's not terrible. I'm just happy that it doesn't bubble up everywhere. If it bubbles up it really negatively effects typing. So far this Mosio cover is smooth. Will update if things change.(I bought the rose gold)"
"on April 1, 2017",Great value - I love this camel color and the way it protects from scratches. Doesn't add much weight either. Thought I probably wouldn't use the keyboard cover but I actually love the way it feels and keeps it more protected in between keys from dust or splashed liquids.
"on September 28, 2016","I am happy with my purchase, My only con about this product is that it does show fingerprints. I have to wipe it down with baby wipes or pledge with a microfiber cloth. It protects my computer though so that is all that matters. You can see the apple logo in the back which is awesome! Depending on the brightness of your screen you can make it really bright or not as bright for the logo to show through.The keyboard protecter is great! I have not had any problems with it. It stays in place, you can even see the light around the keys and a little bit through them. Then screen protector is great quality. I recommend this product! The matte black is very sleek, my macbook air is way more attractive now! Thank you for your product."
"on February 25, 2017",I love this case! it protects your laptop and the keyboard/screen. I just bought my macbook and wanted to make sure that it would be completely protected. This case set comes with everything. The keyboard cover is soft and covers all the keys. The screen protector is nice as well because it fits and isnt too thick. I really love this for my laptop and the color selection is great too! Definetly recommend. Thank you!
"on February 24, 2017","Wonderful and fits a MacBook Air 13 inch perfectly. I bought the camel color, and it's very pretty in person. Almost like a pearl-tan, and it looks very classy. Everything fits perfectly, even the keyboard cover and screen protector. I have a few bubbles in the screen protector but that's almost unavoidable. Also it came with a small black mark on the bottom of the case (see picture) but it isn't so noticeable it's driving my crazy. If it was on the top I would probably exchange it for another top.Overall though I'm extremely happy and it's exactly what I wanted. Would definitely buy again, and might do so when I want a change in color."
"on October 12, 2017","Great!! I wasn't able to fit another MacBook cover on my MacBook Air 13-inch because it had dented in the corner. But the clasp on the Mosiso Plastic Hard case is on the sides instead of the corner, and was able to fit (refer to attached photo). Additionally, the keyboard cover keeps the satisfying ""typing"" feel of the actual MacBook keyboard, while letting a bit of the light through when you're using it in the dark (whereas a previous keyboard cover did not).FYI: the cover is matte and soft to the touch."
"on January 22, 2017","This met expectations for sure. Color matches photo. There's no issue with the case rubbing against itself by the hinge (I know this can be a problem with some MacBook cases). I read in a review before I bought it that the screen protector doesn't work--that was accurate, it's impossible to put it on without bubbles so I threw it away. But like that guy said, the price for the case and the keyboard cover makes it worth it anyway.Just so you know, any keyboard cover on a MacBook Air will cause issues with your laptop speakers, since most (all?) of the sound actually comes out from behind the keyboard. So if you want to listen to music or Netflix or whatever with built-in speakers, you'll probably want to take the keyboard cover off for that. Or use headphones."
"on September 29, 2016","Material is rubbery plastic. It is smooth to the touch. Cover is thin so it doesn't make my MacBook Air bulky, yet protects the cover from being scratched. It has vent openings on the bottom cover. Snaps on, so it's easy to attach.The apple is not exposed. It shines through slightly when macbook is in use.The keyboard cover is a film not a sticker. Still easy to type. The light of the keys shine through. Not as bright though.It comes with replacement foot pads.I didn't put the screen protector on, but it came nicely packaged and not bent. It also comes with a small squigee for placing.Please excuse the stickers. Those are added on after. They do not come with this package."
"on February 15, 2017","Very cheap looking when I pulled it out of the package, but it fit perfectly on my MacBook air. There was a perfectly fitting keyboard cover and a screen protector that was included but not mentioned in the description when ordering. I chose one of my favorite colors and the bland silver MacBook air with that slippery metallic like surface was transformed into a new laptop computer with a unique look and personality. I wish I had gotten one of these when purchasing the MacBook Air and I would have fewer scratches and signs of wear. I can't speak to durability after a few days but given the price I wouldn't mind at all if It doesn't last forever. Definitely recommend."
"on July 27, 2017","I absolutely LOVE this case for my MacBook Air! My old one was from Best Buy and was overpriced, but this one has a good price and looks way better! The color is VERY pretty and it even comes with a keyboard cover (awesome!) and a screen protector (which I haven't used yet). I purchased the ""Serenity Blue"" because I was looking for a comfort color and it is perfect. Looks just like it does on the pictures! I will be recommending this to my friends and I'm sure lots of people will be asking me where I got it. :) #VerySatisfied"
"on September 23, 2017","I love this case, gives the laptop a grip so I don't have to worry about it slipping... This came with a clear screen protector that I chose NOT to install. I am always more concerned about bubbles, if I have to remove it for any reason will there be a residue... My laptop doesn't leave the house and rarely leaves my bedroom so I don't feel the need for screen protection. For the price I would consider getting more just to change it up a bit..."
"on November 11, 2017","The link to this case was shared to me by a classmate. I had previously bought a similar case for  my laptop 2 years ago and it finally broke after so much use. I was not prepared to see this case to be SO much better!! The plastic on this Mosiso is a just little thicker and sturdier. It's still very slim but, it's just a tad more thicker (good thing). and it also comes with the keyboard cover AND screen protector ...all for 13 bucks !!!! This is a steal and definitely worth your money. I got the burgundy color and I love the way it looks on my macbook air. LOVE this product!"
"on January 5, 2017","I really love this case! The price for the items you get is something that can't be beat.The case itself is very slim and it does get dirty quickly, but its nothing a swipe from a wet paper towel can't fix.The keyboard cover is great once you get used to it. It is soft and smooth and really prevents any particles from getting in between the keys.The cloth given didn't really help in cleaning the regular screen itself, I'm not sure about the screen cover as I didn't use it for my laptop.Overall, I'm really glad I purchased this combo set."
"on September 18, 2016","This case is great. It fits very well on my macbook air and the color is beautiful. The cover is very smooth and looks just as pictured in the product info. The keyboard cover makes typing a bit slower so I wont be using that but overall it is great. I was looking for a cover to replace my old one and this does so very well. Would recommend5 stars – I love this item! I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product!4 stars – I like it, but there are some flaws. However, I would purchase this item again.3 stars – The item was just ok, and it worked, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had to.2 stars – There are probably worse products than this, but there are definitely better choices and I would more than likely not purchase this product again.1 star – I dislike this product, and I wish I had not bought it, I can’t recommend it to others and I would not purchase this product again."
"on December 18, 2016","Recently ordered this plastic hard case in the color Wine. I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer a maroon color, as that's what I was originally after, however this case is perfect and I've fallen in love! I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and have had no issues! My only complaint would be with the plastic screen protector. It's sort of a cheap plastic that was difficult for me to apply, and I can currently see air bubbles under the screen which makes me feel as though my screen might be being scratched by the microfibers/dust trapped underneath. Either way, I can always remove the screen protector so this isn't a deal breaker. I frequently fly via plane and use public transportation and I can confidently say that my laptop has been protected against bumps, scratches, and overall outdoor elements. I've gotten lots of compliments on the color and keyboard cover. For the price point listed, this is a lovely product that exceeded my expectations, will definitely repurchase once I grow tired of my current color."
"on November 17, 2017","I have been searching and searching for a solid, durable case for my 13 inch MacBook Pro, and this is it. I have had other cases such as Speck in the past, but this one is definitely the best in my opinion. The matte finish prevents scratches from being visible, and the case itself is very thin and fits like a glove. I have had this case for a year now, and it has only suffered a chip on the bottom left corner of my laptop. However, with this chip, the protection of my laptop has not been compromised, and it has been there for four months now without spreading or getting larger. I highly recommend this case. I will probably order it continually as needed."
"on May 12, 2017",This case works great for my Apple laptop.  I had purchased a Speck case when I first got my laptop and it cracked in a few months.  I purchased the same case again (I loved the color) and it cracked within (it seemed) a few weeks.  I read reviews of the Mosiso case and decided for the price it was worth a try.  I am super pleased with it.  It is thin but still a good protector for the computer.  I didn't use the key pad protector or the screen protector which comes with the case.  The case color was just what I wanted as well.  I've only had it a few weeks so I don't know how it will hold up long term but so far I'm greatly pleased with it.
"on April 5, 2017","I had one like this for my MacBook Pro - and still do.  Now I have this one for my MacBook Air.  One thing they should do is put their brand name somewhere on the product.  There were many to choose from and  I wanted one just like the one I had before.  This is obviously a different company but still works well.  I don't use the keyboard cover.  To me, it makes the keys clumsy.  But it is a lovely added bonus since the case is a good value.  Beautiful color.  Feels silky and wonderful and fits perfect."
"on November 11, 2016","So glad i decided to go with this set. It's perfect because it comes with everything you need and you're not spending an arm and a leg. The Case is sturdy and made out of good material and the keyboard cover definitely helps keep your keyboard clean. I was also very excited that there was a screen protector, however you have to be very precise and careful not to get any bubbles when putting it on. I wasn't careful enough so i actually ended up taking mine off and having to throw it away because the bubbles were bothering me. That was definitely my own fault though, so all in all these products are awesome! Definitely deserves 5 stars!"
"on August 10, 2017","ordered this for me, my other case had broken. i ordered in Marsala red and it's so pretty. it came with literally everything you need to keep your computer protected, but if you dropped it, the case would most likely break. it has white rubber grippers on the bottom so my computer doesn't slide, which i love. super cute and the key board cover doesn't come/fall off at all."
"on February 4, 2017","Love! I am very happy with my MacBook case. It is perfectly crystal clear, letting the beauty of the laptop shine through, while feeling very substantial and capable of protecting my investment. I also purchase a decal separately to spruce it up a bit and it's perfect. I also purchased the same case in a dark burgundy color & am extremely happy with that one as well."
"on September 12, 2017","Everything fits nicely (case, keyboard protector, screen protector) on my MacBook Air 13. As with all screen protectors, it's hard to put it on without some bubbles, but I can,only see them when the screen is off, so they aren't distracting. I feel more comfortable bringing my new laptop back and forth to school with these protections, but I also have it in a padded sleeve when I'm not using it."
"on December 11, 2016","The case fit well, the keyboard cover is perfect, there was absolutely no damage to my case on arrival, and it is clear! I didn't have any of the problems anybody else in the reviews has described- maybe I just got lucky.The order came with: clear top case, clear bottom case, screen protecter (this fits exactly to cover the display portion, doesn't extend out to cover the camera, etc.), 4 extra rubber nubs for the bottom of the case in case one falls off, and a card thing to smooth out bubbles during screen protecter installation.All of my stuff arrived quickly and perfectly as pictured. It's great quality and exactly what I was hoping for!"
"on August 5, 2017","This is a well-designed, well-fitting case at a very reasonable price. I had to return my previous purchase of a different brand of case because it fit poorly and fell off during transport. I have not had that problem with this case at all. It fits my MacBook Air snugly and it stays in place even while being bounced around in my tote bag.The Serenity Blue color is beautiful and I personally like the fact that there is no cut-out so that the lighted Apple logo is diffused through the surface. I clean the case with the same iKlear cleaner that I use on the laptop itself and it cleans up well.Disclaimer: I am not using the screen protector or the keyboard cover but this is solely based on personal preference and is not a commentary on their quality or usefulness."
"on October 7, 2017","Love the lilac color it looks great on my Mac Air.  The case snaps on easy fits perfectly, and keyboard cover is great keeps duff off. However, does diminish the lighted keyboard when typing in low light areas, but that is not a big deal, I have a USB light attachment.  I would purchase again.  Hopefully, there will be a darker purple case (hint: grape or eggplant color), I like anything in the purple family."
"on October 17, 2017","Not usually one to write reviews. I bought this for my wife as a replacement to a larger, bulky, leather / cloth type of cover. 1: I never realized how small her laptop really was because the case was so bulky. THIS one, is so slim and sleek, I love it (as a minimalist) and she loves it for.. pretty much everything else.The keyboard fits snugly, the screen as well. and both panels fit the computer nice and snug. The only thing I would pair this with, Is that the larger bulky case got ""gross"" around the palm rest areas, SO I bought a silver sticker set that covers the mouse pad and palm areas for her computer as well. Total cost <20$. Not to mention it looks like an entirely new laptop. Love it!"
"on October 31, 2017",I love it! I'm someone who researches products before buying and based on reviews and the amazing price I decided to go ahead and order this Mosiso case. It came in exactly when expected and I am very satisfied with the product. The soft matte feel is so nice for such a cheap price. I am also obsessed with the jelly keyboard and have already received so many compliments on the beautiful color!You cannot use a laptop skin under the hard case.
"on September 23, 2017","Came exactly as expected and was very nice quality! I saw a lot of people saying that there were issues with the screen protector, but mine went on fine once I figured out the best technique and used a card to smooth out the air bubbles! Keyboard cover is nice and very easy to put on, and make sure to put on the top so that the 3 ""hooks"" are on top and the two hooks are on the bottom (if that makes sense). Biggest issue for me was not knowing whether the bottom actually fit well and I think it might've been a bit too small (only one side actually snapped on), but that's not an issue at all and my laptop still feels very secured. Overall I'm very glad to have chosen mosiso over other brands that I had seen!!"
"on November 25, 2017","Had a speck which cracked in less than a year after being put in my laptop bag. Speck worked and protected the corner, but $50 and cannot use anymore. This fits very well. Haven't dropped it yet, so not sure about the all out protection, but will update if it is less than adequate once that happens. Cannot beat the cost."
"on March 17, 2017","Although I haven't used the screen protector, I do really like the rest.  The hard case was easy to snap on and stays securely.  I love the red color I chose.  A surprise was how much I like the keyboard cover!  I hadn't planned to use it but put it on (it slipped on really easily).  I find it much more simple to type with the cover on, so kept it.  Love that it matches the color of the hard case.  In all, I am very happy with my purchase."
"on August 10, 2017","i got the case today and i love it! it is a perfect fit and looks so sleek and nice on my macbook air! i got it in airy blue and it is the perfect color for me, you can still see the apple logo when the computer is open and the feel of the case is silky and smooth! i dont know the longevity of this case or how well it protects the computer, but i do think it adds a least a little protection and i feel safer with my computer in this case then on its own. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone!"
"on August 18, 2017","I bought this case for my daughter's Macbook Air for school. I had looked at many different cases and decided on this brand after much research. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on one, but did want one that provided ample protection.  This is the perfect one too. It was very easy to snap on as well. I am now no longer worried about her computer any longer."
"on October 8, 2017","This was simple to snap onto my Mac. I like how the apple glows through the case when the laptop is in use. It has a soft feel, and I like that. I've never used a keyboard piece like this before, and it is taking a little getting used to, but I like it. I may purchase another for the MacBook we use for the church."
"on October 27, 2017","I LOVE this laptop case - particularly the color. I was worried the beige would be boring, but it's a nice soft tan color, and I get a ton of compliments on it. Whenever this one wears out, I'll definitely be buying another. However, because of the light color, the case does get dirty easily, and it's difficult to clean smudges off. The little white rubber feet on the bottom also come off pretty easily (I've had this case for a few months now and I feel like I'm constantly sticking them back on). But those are very minor complaints - the case was easy to snap on, has held up really well, and I will be back for another."
"on August 21, 2016","This is a great computer case! It fits my macbook air 13 inch perfectly! It is easy to put on too. It is a hard plastic but with a soft feel. This will really protect your computer, but also still make your computer look stylish. This comes in a variety of colors so there is something for everyone. Also this comes with a keyboard cover that fits nicely and will help to protect crumbs or dust from getting under the keys. Overall, this is a really nice set of top and bottom case and I would absolutely recommend this!I received this product for free or at a discount for the purpose of testing out the product and writing an honest and unbiased review. All opinions and thoughts expressed are entirely my own."
"on June 12, 2017",I am very pleased with it. It came very quick and was very easy to put on. I really I love the way the apple sings shows through the case. I got the purple one and I love it. It so weird at first getting used the keys and the ways it feels. Im satisfied for the money I paid for it.
"on October 23, 2017","This is the first time I bought a Mosiso computer case. I was so impressed with the quality of the product (and the outstanding price) that I bought one for my mom's computer. They are about a quarter of the price for something you get at a tech store and it is more durable than any other computer case that I have purchased. Plus, the additional features (such as the screen protector and keyboard cover) were a great added bonus. I will continue to buy this product when my case wears out (or if I want another color). Such a great find!!"
"on April 21, 2017","I bought this rose-gold cover to go with my iPhone and the rose-gold accents in my office.  It matches my phone just about perfectly and looks great in my office.  It fits just fine on my Apple MacBook Air.  It doesn't have the Apple cut-out, but I knew that going in and bought it anyway because of the reasonable price.  Happy with my purchase."
"on May 15, 2017","I've gone through quite a few Speck Cases and I finally decided to get out of my comfort zone. This case is easily 10x better AND cheaper! It looks good and it hasn't broken from just taken it in and out of my backpack which is what the others did. It's a nice color and it feels smooth. Also, the rubber feet on the bottom ARE STILL THERE and it's been about a month! I'm so impressed at the minimum things this case is doing because other brands are crap! This is exactly what I needed! AND it comes with a keyboard cover that actually fits! Super impressed!"
"on April 26, 2017","The color of this case is very pretty. I got it in the light rose color, a very milky, subdued pink which I adore. The quality of the case looks very expensive and not cheap at all. I've ordered three MacBook cases in total on Amazon and this one is by far the best one."
"on August 1, 2016","Awesome case cover for Macbook Air 13"" !!!!I was looking at some cases to get for my macbook air 13"" screen. I looked through many and decided to risk getting this one. When I got it in the mail, it looked really nice. I liked it from the first sight! When I put it on my laptop, it gave my laptop a completely new look and I love it.The case fits exactly to my laptop and I fell like it would really protect my laptop from scratches and dents. Now I don't have to worry about kids touching the laptop as much or taking it with me wherever I go. It doesn't feel as fragile anymore. Do not hesitate to buy this product, it is worth its price.I received this product at a discount for an honest, unbiased review in exchange. Thank you."
"on May 5, 2017","My mom wanted a cover for her MacBook. She loves my deep-blue cover similar to this one. When we looked at all the options, this was the only company who made a purple cover with intense enough color that she liked. She's had it for a month and loves it."
"on May 1, 2017",For the price this can't be beat.  Snapped right on.  Has a better grip to it than just the plain case.  I am not a fan of the keyboard cover. It fits well but for some reason I find it harder to type with it on.  It is amazing how much dirt and grime it captures though keeping it out of the keyboard. Highly recommend.
"on November 18, 2017",I LOVE THIS HARD CASE PROTECTOR!!!!such a cute pink. looks perfect on my MacBook Air. I had no problems snapping it on or even taking it off. the only thing I would say is that if it does get dirt on it it is almost nearly impossible to clean it all off. I have two little spots on it and I have tried everything to take it off. but over all I really like the case!
"on May 29, 2017","100% would recommend this case to anyone!Pros:1. very slim, not bulky at all2. easy to snap right on3. sleek looking, matte, apple logo shines through (on outside of laptop)4. keyboard cover fits perfectly and doesn't slide aroundCons.1. case is a little tricky to remove, but I guess that is kind of a good thing as well2. keyboard cover is a little hard to type with AND blocks sound since speakers are in keys, but I assume that would be with any keyboard coverAll in all, ESPECIALLY for the price,  think the product is no doubt about it worth every penny. It might not be the most protective but for a nice look and slim snap on case I think this is really perfect."
"on August 18, 2017","Got the camel color, it's matte and I love it. Actually the color I wish the actual computer was. Fits great and the packaging was done well too."
"on June 12, 2017",Very pleased! Comes with a hard case (for bottom and top) a silicone colored keyboard protector and a clear screen protector. Good quality - excellent price. Very happy and plan to order other colors!
"on February 28, 2017","I bought my case never having heard of this brand before. The shipping was very fast and the packaging was nice. I absolutely love the airy blue color of my case and I really like that it is a hard plastic, but it has a matte finish. The keyboard cover fits perfectly. I liked that it also came with a screen protector, but when I applied it, it was smaller than the screen. It did not fully cover the entire screen from edge to edge, but when I emailed them about this problem, they were very helpful and they sent me a new one free of charge. This case does not have a cut out for the apple on your mac, in case thats what your looking for. Overall, given that it only cost $14, it is a very nice case! I really like it and I love how it looks on my Macbook Air!"
"on December 29, 2017","The case I chose was the deep teal color and it is very pretty. I was tempted to buy the typical marble cover or rose gold or whatever girly cover we basic chicks go for, but opted for this instead. I’m happy with this decision as it is simple and slightly unique because of the color. The cover was thin and light, so it doesn’t add a lot of weight to the laptop. It does have that frosted rubber type material so yes, you can see fingerprints after awhile if you aren’t careful but you can easily clean it up. Finally, I did not use the protective screen cover or the keyboard cover so this review is only on the outer case for the MacBook Air."
"on January 21, 2017","This case is gorgeous and perfect. I used to own the ibenzer case. The ibenzer one soon got scratches on it and was quite hard to install. It was so hard to remove that I thought I was breaking my laptop. You have no idea how hard and uneasy that one went. This one, on the contrary, is super easy to install & remove, and the case has a better texture. Plus they give you a free keyboard cover which is even better than the keyboard cover that I bought somewhere else. Dumping my ibenzer and adding this to my list in case I need another one."
"on October 24, 2017","Bright, hot pink, easy to attach to my new laptop, comfortable pink key pad and even a plastic sheet cover for the laptop screen, this is exactly what I’d hoped for.  It arrived on time and at a very fair price.  So glad I ordered it!"
"on May 27, 2017","My husband and I purchased one for each of our 13"" MacBook Air. We needed a way to tell them apart so the shell was an excellent option. The cover is a great deal for the price. Very easy to install (I install both). The screen protector was a challenge but I was able to get each one on with very little resistance. The keyboard cover is a nice touch since I typically wear out the keyboard lettering from lots of use. We purchased the pink and the aqua blue.  We are both pleased with our purchase."
"on September 26, 2017","I didn't expect the quality to be this great but it's a lot better than my old case. It came just on time and the color is really pretty too! ( I got in serenity blue) it's totally matte and has a rubberized texture. The only thing is that when I run my hands over it feels gritty not smooth, but I mean for the price and quality of the product that can be overlooked. The screen protector is hard to put on if you don't get it on the first try you will definitely have air bubbles. The keyboard cover is really nice though and I love how it matches the color of the cover."
"on October 11, 2017","love this! I had bought a keyboard cover earlier this year and it never sat well on my keyboard and made typing hard. I love that there is a keyboard cover included in this bundle that actually works! The outer shell fit perfectly, too!"
"on September 16, 2017",It was a nice hard cover for mac book but when I ordered i didn't read descriptions carefully. When I tried to fit it with my mac book it didn't fit because I ordered the wrong item. It comes with screen protector and keyboard cover. Did not return because I have to pay for shipping and handling which will cost me $8.00 so I decided to buy another one which only cost me $6.99 from other vendor.
"on June 20, 2017",It doesn't look like the picture a prettier purple in my opinion! Came with a screen protector which is super cool! I'm not sure how to put it on but I'll figure it out later. Easy just snaps on. So far I like it!
"on May 14, 2017","It is a very nice case and is a really pretty color. There were no scratches, dents, or marks when it arrived and it fit perfectly. Also, it didn't make my laptop thick or too heavy. The keyboard cover and screen protector are very nice additions as well."
"on October 12, 2017","Very satisfied with this purchase. The cover fit perfectly and it even came with replacement grips on the bottom. I bought the color camel, which has a hint more purple than it shows online. The customer service is great too. My bottom cover came defective as there were no two snaps on the front. I contacted their customer service and they promptly sent a replacement. My last laptop case from another brand lasted a good year and a half before pieces started cracking, so I will update this review when this case starts breaking apart."
"on November 9, 2017","This case is awesome! So much cheaper than Best Buy, plus you get a screen protector and keyboard cover! The cover stays on perfectly, and the screen protector is an exact match for the screen with no part of the screen exposed. I will definitely be buying this again when it's time!"
"on April 3, 2017",I Ordered this product for my daughters laptop and she loves it. It fits perfect and the color is as pictured. The keyboard cover was an added bonus. I ordered a different brand cover and returned it because it did not fit correctly.  Decided to or this one and so happy we did. I would recommend this product.
"on August 16, 2017","This case was exactly what I asked for! At first, I ordered the wrong case for the laptop, and the return process was simple! The product is as described, coming with the laptop screen protector and keyboard protector too! I got in in the dark red and it was a lovely color. The only problem with it was that fingerprints leave greasy marks on it, but it could simply be fixed with a computer wipe or towel and water!"
"on August 29, 2017","Mine came in today and I have to say I am very pleased with the hard case! I ordered mine in grey , the case is matte transparent grey soft to the touch. Took me 3 minutes to put on the case , wasn't hard at all. I put on the screen protector and it looks great! The keyboard cover is great and the keys lights still shine through it! I was very pleased!"
"on May 30, 2017","Similar to the case that I bought directly from Apple for another Mac, but it costs $30 less.  Excellent protection and very easy to install.  Great value. Also comes with a keyboard cover that fits perfect for this computer."
"on December 14, 2016","I love this case and keyboard cover! It fits well and I love the texture. I didn't end up using the screen protector as it was a little flimsy, but I didn't buy this set for that so it's fine with me. As another reviewer said, the keyboard cover does make it a little difficult if you are typing a full essay, but for regular use, it is great! If nothing else, it will keep dust and nastiness from getting on/in your keyboard. The case is a little bit more opaque than I imagined, but that isn't a problem. It is a great set for the price and after this one gets a little wear and tear, I will definitely buy another one just like it!"
"on February 26, 2017","This is a solid case that i expect will give me years of protection for my new MacBook Air.  I doubt I'll ever use the keyboard protector, unless someone can tell me how to secure it to the keyboard without it constantly being in danger of slipping off.  If I'm missing something here or didn't read the instructions well, please let me know.  It's a good idea, but .Also, when I saw the four extra white adhesive buttons, I thought I was supposed to put them somewhere on the case.  Now I realize they are extras in case I lose one or more of the ones already on the case.  A nice touch.  Thanks."
"on November 30, 2016","I am a very careful person, and I'd like to buy a good stuff with the lowest price, but I hate the poor quality thing. So I am so hesitating before order this set of mac protection case, because this is too cheap comparing with other products. I saw some unpleasant comments, and doubt whether I should buy it or not. However, when I receive this product and put on my laptop, that is so fit! wonderful! comfortable touch for both the keyboard and case, the screen protector is proper, too. Recommend to those hesitating people!"
"on July 22, 2017",What a great bargain. I had looked for a cover for my keyboard and this one is thin enough to not interfere with typing! Love the pink snap on shell to protect my laptop. Haven't put the screen cover on yet.
"on September 18, 2017","Great product for a even better price. I got a similar case to this from Best Buy and spent over $40 on it, it almost cracked immediately. This case snapped on easy and looks really good."
"on September 15, 2017","I purchased this case almost a week ago and I'm loving it so far. The wine color is amazing!! Keyboard cover fits great even though I read a lot of reviews about it not fitting properly. The MacBook case itself is a bit hard to remove, but I don't care lol. I still love it!! I totally recommend this Mosiso MacBook case & keyboard cover. (I added my own sugar skull sticker, it didn't come with it)"
"on November 7, 2016",Exactly as shown. I love it. It's a great deal including keyboard cover and screen protector. Everything fits perfectly.
"on October 2, 2017","Fits great, didn’t have trouble putting it on. And feel way safer with my Mac air  now. I have a roommate and the rubber key board cover keeps the buttons from making the clicking sound. Works as a silencer. Down part is the letters don’t light up through it but doesn’t really bother me"
"on July 8, 2017","Great case for the price! Mine did not come broken like others, it was easy to put on. I love it. Just wish it didn't cover the apple logo and also when you put the keyboard protector on it kinda muffles the sound when you play music or a movie! But it's not much of a block. But I find it difficult to type when you have the keyboard cover on. but other than that 5 stars!"
"on August 7, 2017","Great cover shell, but make sure you get correct size for your model MacBook as some years have special sizing. This is translucent so you see the color of the laptop thru the case."
"on August 19, 2017","This case perfectly fits my daughter's MacBook Air 13.3.  It covers both front and back and came with a keyboard cover as well. Also came with a screen protector, but she had trouble putting that in without it bubbling, so she's not using it. She loves it!  Classes haven't started yet, so I'm not sure how sturdy it will be when she starts carrying it around, but so far, we are extremely happy with this purchase. It looks amazing!"
"on May 12, 2017","Initially I ordered the wrong one, which was my mistake, but once i received the right case, looks great! Great feeling I ordered the blue one which brings a lot of colors to my laptop.It looks amazing!"
"on July 26, 2017","This cover is great! The only things that I would critique are very minor. 1.) the screen protector is extremely difficult to put on as it is statically attracted to the screen, causing it to stick to unnecessary places. Thus, your bound to get dirt underneath. Also, it doesn't fit is all the way. It's about 2-3 millimeters off. 2.) the actual front of the case doesn't have the apple already or an indentation or anything. When the computer is off, it's complete solid colored. You'll only see the apple when it turns on. Personally, I own the MacBook Air with the apple that lights up in the front. I can't say whether this is the same for the MacBook pros, but if it is, you'll never see the apple again as it doesn't light up. 3.) because you can't see the orientation of the apple, you may try to open the wrong side 4.) the clear circle of the caps lock button on the keyboard cover doesn't line up perfectly to the actual light. That doesn't bother me too much but it may bother others. Overall though, it's very sleek, has a nice texture, and its of a great price point. Honestly, I love it. It ensures that the actual laptop won't get too many scratches and such, so I can easily sell it if I want to upgrade in the future."
"on September 4, 2017",This case is very well-made and the pink is a cute color!  It looks like it will provide good protection for the Mac.  The matching keyboard skin was a nice bonus too.
"on October 5, 2016",Happy with my new case. Ordered the Marsala Red and I love it. And most important the delivery was right on time. For sure I'll will be buying another color in the near future.
"on May 25, 2017","Very nice fit, easy to put on and perfect keyboard cover. I didn't use the screen protector- it doesn't cover the entire screen, and it's not touch screen so this doesn't really make sense."
"on October 15, 2016",Got mine this morning and I can't complain. I like that it's rubberized instead of a plasticky material. I don't regret purchasing it especially for the price.
"on August 14, 2017",I love this case! I got it in the color Serenity Blue and it looks exactly how it did in the picture. It fit the model A1466 perfectly.
"on November 5, 2017","My case had a little crack, but the seller contacted me and sent me a new one. I like their service very much! And they didn't get back the old one, so I didn't have to return it.The case is really beautiful, and I love the color. The screen protector is a little hard to put on, and I still get some bubbles on the screen. But it is fine, and I like the case come with a cloth to clean the screen.I would recommend this case to anyone who want to buy a case for Mac"
"on September 6, 2017","Arrived in great shape no scratches nothing perfect. The color is as expected .....which ever color you choose thats the one you are going to receive. I got the serenity blue and its beautiful, its also pretty hard case the computer feels secure. Highly recommend this product!"
"on August 14, 2017","So far so good, got this immediately after i received my mac book air to protect it. i got the light purple case and i love the way it looks on. such a good deal for the case, keyboard sleeve and screen protector."
"on March 13, 2017","Yessss I am loving my MacBook Air cover. It is the best. Exactly as described, the keyboard covers fits like a glove, the hard case protects my computer and you can it light up so clearly on the back of the MacBook. Thank you for a great product and price. Loveeeeeeeee it. I can't say anymore than I wish I could give more than 5 STARS!!!!"
"on July 19, 2017",Purchased the airy blue case and color matches the picture. Case is good quality. Had for about two months and hasn't cracked or anything. Fits perfectly to my 13 in macbook air. Keypad doesn't match up perfectly to the keys but it's not too bad. Does the job. And the screen protector was super easy to put on and good quality. Great product especially for the price. Would purchase again.
"on February 7, 2017",Very good. Excellent delivery time. Good Amazon seller. Highly Recommended.
"on April 5, 2017",Great product!The cover is slim and pretty. It also helps avoiding sliding on an angled surface which is a great quality.The keyboard protection is great. It's easy to remove to clean.
"on August 2, 2017","Cute, easy assembly, screen protector easy to apply. Apple still shines through. Keyboard is ok but the backlighting doesn't shine through, no big deal. Can't beat the price."
"on May 14, 2017","What a nice fit! It fits my MacBook Air 13.3"" perfectly! The quality of this cover is first rate... and shipping was fast and simple! A highly recommended product!"
"on November 30, 2016",The color is lovely and I love using it! I have a MacBook Air and the case fits perfectly. The keyboard cover also fits well.
"on October 24, 2017","I love my case and keyboard cover! However, I couldn’t get the screen protector on without so many bubbles and weirdly, after I cleaned the screen, there was still stuff under the protector. So I removed it before it would scratch my screen, but I don’t see much need for that anyways. The case fits my MacBook Air perfectly and will definitely purchase more in the future!"
"on January 19, 2017","I love the color and the way my keys look with the mint green keyboard protector. Before this case, I purchased a more expensive one from a different company (Speck) and immediately had problems with it cracking and chipping, even though I took good care of it. I decided to try something different and came across the Mosiso Plastic Hard Case. I've had absolutely no problems and would definitely recommend this case to others."
"on December 22, 2017",Everything came quick and is really good quality. The keyboard cover matched the case perfectly and the case itself is such a lovely color (got it in camel) + is matte and has a nice feel to it. Would definitely buy again!
"on September 14, 2017","I love this cover & key board cover.  It fits snugly, as it should, and I can't even tell that I am typing on a keyboard cover. I am delighted with this purhase and have no hesitation in recommending it to others."
"on April 5, 2017",I was not expecting much for this price but i was surprised with the quality and extras that came with it like screen protector and keyboard cover. The case is a perfect fit!
"on March 4, 2017","I had another product very similar to this cover(s), however not as well made.  Believe it or not, the feet are so much better on this cover - and you sent extras.  Everything about this set is great.  I feel great about this purchase."
"on August 29, 2017",This fits so well and looks beautiful on my MacBook!!!!
"on November 3, 2017","Beautiful color, light weight material that provides adequate protection from daily wear and tear, and very early to put on."
"on November 6, 2016",
"on June 4, 2017","I like this case very much - I bought both the clear and dark red ones. The clear is completely see through and shiny, while the dark red has a matte feel. Both look very classy. I haven't had any issues with the case getting torn, but I keep the Mac in the case and then in a laptop sleeve as well which should solve that issue."
"on August 14, 2016","Love it! The rose gold color I ordered is a more matte pink than expected but I love it! Great quality too, fits my laptop perfectly and stays on nice. The keyboard cover doesn't stick on very well (but I don't think it's meant too) it works fine for just typing! Also the apple logo does shine through the case!"
"on March 13, 2017","Snapped right onto my Macbook Air to protect it.  I like the silicon keyboard cover. The screen cover was easy to put on.  I saw a coworkers and ordered based off her recommendation. All in all, simple product and makes me feel better when handling my laptop."
"on September 4, 2017","This case seems like a great quality for the price. The bottom and top are easy to put on (as well as remove, which is important for cleaning). I like the matte finish, and the fact that the case has some flexibility and give to it. The keyboard cover fits nicely. The screen protector was a little bit of a pain to put on because of removing the air bubbles, so I'm not sure how worth it that will be.**Update: One thing I only recently noticed about the keyboard cover is that it muffles the sound (i.e. when playing music) compared to when the cover is off."
"on June 14, 2017",SO cute and feminine which was what i was looking for. It's also really soft. it looks just like the pictures and i'm very happy with the purchase. Photos attached.
"on September 14, 2017",I usually always look at the reviews of the products I am going to buy before I buy them to make sure I get my moneys worth and I did it was super cute !! I'm in love with the rose gold case! Thank you! :)
"on December 13, 2017","I love this case! it includes everything you need to keep your laptop clean and protected.definitely, recommend to anyone. The case and the keyboard fit my laptop perfectly!also you just can't​ beat the price"
"on May 2, 2017",The case was a nice deep color.  It also comes with a keyboard cover that matches perfectly.  There is also a screen cover.  This is a great investment to protect your laptop.
"on November 5, 2017",Second time buying and it was for my sister. Exact size and fit for her mac and same goes for the keyboard cover. It also included a small cloth and a film screen protector.
"on October 24, 2017","I love this case. It fit my Macbook perfectly, and came with a keyboard cover and screen cover."
"on May 10, 2017",I purchased the wine red color and it looks very nice on my laptop.It was easy to put on and everything clipped right into place!:)
"on December 18, 2017",I've been using these cases for 5 years or so I'm not a super careful person so I've dropped my mac a few times with the case on and theres not damage to the mac but the case breaks a little I've gotten 3 in the last three years but I like the changes.
"on September 13, 2016",I just got my pink case and I'm in love. The color is so pretty and it look like quality. Very chic
"on July 23, 2017","Perfect color and feels nice! The added screen protector, extra rubber feet and a keyboard cover is a lot for the price"
"on September 30, 2017",Love this case! It fits perfectly and gives my MacBook extra protection.  I use the key cover as well although that took me a little while to get used to. It changes the feel of the keys but protects them from dirt and spills. It's easy to take on and off if you don't like the feel.
"on September 29, 2016","Just got it in the mail today and LOVE it! First, it shipped out on the 26th and was delivered this morning which is the fastest I've ever received a package. It fits perfectly and the color is great. There were some bubbles on the screen protector, but you don't see them when the computer is on. Love it!"
"on August 6, 2017",Easy and does the job!
"on November 16, 2016",Amazing! Perfectly matches my rose gold iPhone and iPad set! ❤️The cover has a nice metallic tone to it with some sparkles.
"on January 21, 2018","This case is cute and thin so it does not get in the way; however, this means that it does not protect the laptop.  All-in-all, it has held up and been great value for the price.  I am planning on adding more stickers to the back of the case."
"on December 4, 2017","I love it my MacBook Air looks beautiful, it seems to be a good quality case and the color is matte pink sand."
"on February 17, 2017",I am very satisfied with the products. The case installed very easily and stays tight unless I overextend the lid.  The color (purple) doesn't show finger prints or smudges and provides good protection from scratches. The keyboard cover helps my keyboarding be quieter while maintaining the same responsiveness. I already have a privacy screen installed so I can't comment on the screen protector.
"on August 5, 2017",I love this case. The color is exactly as described & it fits great. The only downside is the keyboard cover does muffle the sound of the speakers a bit. But it's not that big of a deal for me.
"on July 24, 2017",This case actually stays on and fits perfect and I love the keyboard cover!!! 10/10 recommend!
"on December 4, 2016","Although the package did not come in the allotted time (2 days late even when I had Prime 2 day shipping), I was extremely happy with this product. I only expected the hard case and the keyboard cover but it also came with a screen protector (yay!) and it fit my Macbook Air perfectly! Color was true to picture."
"on December 29, 2016","Looks very nice and will protect the outside surfaces of my laptop well.  I don't know if I like the keyboard cover yet, but that was a bonus anyway.  I would have ordered the case even if it came without the keyboard cover.  The case snapped on very easily.  I haven't tried to use the screen protector."
"on August 18, 2017","The case itself is great, very solid for the price. It comes with a keyboard and screen protectors which is a nice addition. Most importantly, however, the company is extremely nice and helpful. I received a defective product and they sent me a new one within a couple of days. Great customer service!"
"on August 5, 2017",Fit perfectly.
"on January 28, 2018","I bought two of these laptop cases, one for me and my friend. We couldn’t be more happy with them! They are absolutely true to color and fit perfectly on our laptops. I’d recommend them to anyone."
"on December 7, 2017",Very nice item - EXACTLY what my daughter was looking for!
"on May 14, 2017","Awesome. Easy to apply to computer. Looks great, very good price."
"on April 4, 2017",5 stars. Great case.
"on January 7, 2018","came exactly as posted, love the smooth rubberized surface, looks very elegant!some tips for applying screen protector: make sure you do this in a dust-free area and a place with a lot of sunlight!! every little speck of dust on the screen makes a bubble, so i would first wipe your screen with the damp, little lint free cloth it comes with, and then use a dry section to wipe it dry, then form a piece of tape into an ""O"" with  and tap away pieces of dust, being careful not to touch the screen. once you get EVERY piece of dust out of the screen, then you can apply the screen protector. first remove the film which says ""remove before application"" or ""remove this first"" and apply the film onto the screen. any air bubbles formed can be pressed and slid away with the white card that it comes with. remember to trace the edges with the card too. when you are done, you may remove the second film which says ""remove after application"", and you are finished!"
"on October 25, 2017","Great fit, Easy to install, Feels durable."
"on October 15, 2017","The plastic case fits perfectly over the MacBook Air. My teenage daughter had no trouble installing the case including the screen protector. Initially, I thought she might have some difficulties with the screen protector, but it wasn't an issue for her. She really like the case so far. Thank you."
"on September 11, 2017",I love this case!
"on November 6, 2017",I just purchased this in clear and it's fantastic.  the cover clicked on with no problem and it's super durable.  I have no issues with this product and it doesn't' impede the usage of my laptop at all.  my only complaint is that I didn't purchase this for my last MacBook!
"on January 2, 2017","I take my time to buy anything and read reviews, I took my chances on this and I am very pleased, fits perfect on my apple, the screen easy to apply I had to do it slowly. first time ever to use a keyboard cover I like it and looks cute I order everything on pink quartz."
"on May 16, 2017","BEAUTIFUL! Not only does it look nice & stylish... it protects your keyboard from lint, crumbs & dust. Love it!! Thanx :]"
"on March 14, 2017","Product as expected.  Watched 16 year old place it onto her MacBook Air in just a few seconds.  Now she's off to the races.  A cool deep green color and for those who care, yes you can see the Apple logo through the cover."
"on August 4, 2017",The case fit perfectly on my 2017 Mac Book Air looks clean and will protect it from any scratches. And the rubber key board that came with it fit and felt great. The screen protector it came with did fit but I messed up when installing it so I'm currently not using it.
"on May 13, 2017","Exactly what I wanted. It fit my laptop perfect and the color is really pretty. The case is hard plastic with a matte feel finish. I personally didn't get this for protection, but it will protect against scratches. It's definitely a great price and good product!"
"on December 29, 2016","fits my 2016 Mac Book Air perfectly! only issue is the matte on the case makes it hard for it to slide in easily into my Amazon Basics case. I love that this was a one-stop-shop; I got the keyboard case, cover AND screen protector in one which is a rare find."
"on August 25, 2017","Awesome case, great color. Can't go wrong with gray. XoxoDid have trouble putting it on but I'm weak af so like one of my friends did it and I'm in love."
"on January 9, 2018",Great product and exactly as shown and stated above. Shipping was even faster than anticipated! Highly recommend.
"on November 28, 2017",Everything fit perfectly and it shipped super quick. Great buy
"on October 14, 2017","Great value for the money. It hasn’t fallen off of my laptop, it fits properly, and was easy to install. So far I have no complaints. The color is true to the picture (I got dark green). I would definitely recommend."
"on February 26, 2017",I love my case! easy to put on! It snapped right on! My color is light purple.
"on October 20, 2016",Color is nice. Lightweight material. Keypad cover is just right. Easy to type. Case fits perfectly.
"on July 17, 2017",Great price for everything that came included
"on November 8, 2017",This is awesome.  Cover fits perfectly over the MacBook Air and the keyboard cover fits perfectly.  Makes the keyboard a soft touch keyboard.
"on January 8, 2017","I really like this cover! It's super strong and sturdy, and the keyboard cover does a great job as well. The cover was a little tough to put on and took a few tries, but once I got it on I was definitely confident that it would do its job well."
"on September 26, 2017",This is a great case. It is smooth and looks nice on the computer. It fit perfectly. We bought both black and teal. The teal is a great color.
"on May 24, 2017",I love it ! It looks amazing ❤️ I love harry potter and love this sticker very simple to put on
"on November 11, 2017","Beautiful and sleek. Case clipped on perfectly and no issues, so did the keyboard. Keyboard is soft and comfortable to type with. Love it!! Would recommend this to my friends."
"on January 18, 2017",I am 25 and ordered the mosiso cover after spending way too much in the Apple Store on one that cracked very easily. Not only do I love the color but the the set comes with a screen protector and keyboard cover that doesn't stick to your fingers. Never written a review before but find this company well worth it!!
"on August 18, 2017","I debated this case for two weeks, but it was all worth it in the end. It fits great, looks great. I was worried about not being able to see that apple logo on the front because I didn't want my computer looking cheap but it definitely shows. great product!"
"on May 24, 2017",Fits perfectly on my MacBook Air! No complaints. Looks great!
"on August 21, 2017",the price was pretty good foe everything it comes with. I am satisfied
"on August 9, 2017","Received my black case today, very satisfied with my purchase! The keyboard cover was definitely a plus! Very happy that the Apple logo is still visible thru the black case, which is what I wanted!!"
"on April 15, 2017",I got my case about a week ago.  It arrived on time and was easy to snap it on my computer.  I didn't use the screen protector because I can never apply those without bubbles.
"on November 15, 2017",I love the color and the kids in student ministry love the keyboard protector.
"on March 10, 2017","I would buy this again in a heartbeat - everything fits perfectly, it protects my computer, and in addition - it makes me look SUPER COOL!"
"on January 16, 2017",This is a perfect case for me! Great protection and shipped on time with no damage.
"on January 16, 2018",Does it’s job and is really cute fits perfect and I get compliments all the time
"on September 15, 2017","Happy with this case! Was skeptical when I ordered, but glad I did. Color is the same as the picture, fits good, and the keyboard cover is really nice too. I didn't use the screen proctecor. Would order again!"
"on August 28, 2017",Good product. Fits my laptop well.
"on February 22, 2017",I purchased this for my son's MacBook Air and he loves it. It fits very well and looks great. The ease of installation was wonderful. Extra bonus is the color is almost an exact match for his college colors.
"on July 25, 2017","great case! for this price you can't beat it! love it! sturdy and it came with the case itself, a keyboard cover, and a screen protector! I am so pleased!"
"on April 25, 2017",Love the color!! Very beautiful! I also love the fact that it's matte.
"on October 16, 2017",I love the case and especially the keyboard cover. I made a mistake and spilled water on my laptop and thankfully I had the keyboard cover. It’s very stylish
"on September 23, 2017",Wonderful and completely worth the money. I delivered as standard and got it in 3 days. Holds everything I need it to
"on August 4, 2017",Good case. Looks beautiful.
"on September 15, 2017",I received my case for my MacBook today and I love it. Everything fits perfect.
"on October 14, 2017","First macbook, first case, and I love it! I chose the camel color and it is perfect. It took me awhile to actually get the case on because I couldn’t figure it out but not to worry I figured it out. It is nice to the touch which makes me want to carry it around with me everywhere. I also love the keyboard cover; fits perfect, and looks great. Love love love this color. Would recommend and will buy again!"
"on January 5, 2017",Fits well. Material seems more sturdy than another brand that I had previously that cracked. Great product for the money Fast delivery...arrived sooner than expected during busy Christmas season.
"on March 12, 2017",The product fit nicely and looks great.Thanks!
"on December 10, 2017","This plastic hard case is easy to attach, fits perfect and is exactly what I was looking for."
"on December 21, 2017","Great case for a good price, love it so far will see how long this one lasts with the wear and tear I put on cases. Usually, if all the plastic tabs are there after 4 months it holds up well."
"on August 14, 2017","Very nice product. This is such a good price for so many items. The screen protector, key board cover, and the case. Worth the buy."
"on July 27, 2017",We love this case! So pretty and easy to install. Screen protector is a huge plus. Not using keyboard protector just because it feels weird for me. Just my opinion though. Maybe I'll get used to it. But I would buy this set over and over again in different colors!
"on October 14, 2017",Case and keyboard are amazing. Screen protector is kinda junk but didn’t really order it for that. That was just a free extra piece
"on March 24, 2017",Extremely satisfied with my purchase! I love the color and the keyboard cover is just the right color that I can still see the lighted keyboard. The screen protector is an added bonus. Thank you for making a great product.
"on January 21, 2018",I think it's great! I think the keyboard cover was a nice touch as most other covers I've seen don't come with it.  It fit and makes the computer stand out more.
"on November 10, 2016","I loved having the case, keyboard protector and screen protector all in one purchase. The quality is great and it is very stylish. I think this purchase will go along way in protecting my. new MacBoook Air. Delivery was easy and customer service from Mosio was top notch."
"on May 8, 2017",I like the pink. Friend told me it's a nice case. Durable. Been using for a while. Fits really good.
"on September 5, 2017",We love this case! It's the perfect UK blue and it's nice and sturdy. It arrived very quickly and is just what we wanted! We'll be ordering another one for our new laptop!

"on December 18, 2017",This case fits my MacBook Air perfectly and is a beautiful cover. The keyboard skin also fits nicely!
