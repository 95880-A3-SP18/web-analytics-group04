"on February 6, 2018","I purchased this a while ago and just came around to applying the pieces. There were no instructions with the product. Yes, it's easy to figure out but it still seems that instructions should be a basic component of any product. The color is true to the picture. The case feels silken and just needed to be snapped on. The keyboard cover is silicone, I gather, and feels silken, too. It doesn't have an adhesive surface which is good and bad. Good because it doesn't ruin the actual keyboard and easy to remove. Bad because it's always slightly warped in one corner (for me it's the right lower corner: from backward slash down to arrows). The typing seems slightly hindered as if buttons need to be depressed harder but that may just be a getting used issue. The screen cover is a bit of a pain because applying it without bubbles is a trick task....it cannot happen. So, I capitulated to having bubbles. I should mention that the laptop is noticeably heavier after applying everything. For the price, it seems ok enough for now. Will update review after a while of using the case and cover."
"on November 25, 2017","The case snaps onto the computer (a little tricky to get on) but then it really stays on. The issue with my last shell case was that the snaps broke and it wouldn't stay on, but this one seems like it will last a long time. The keyboard cover fits perfectly so there aren't any little bumps. I have not used the screen protector, but it is nicely packaged and has a dust-free cleaning cloth with it. A great purchase! My one qualm is that the case really absorbs oil, so if your fingers are oily and you touch the case it leaves marks. But you start to not notice it after a while.EDIT: After about four months of use (I'm never too rough with my computer) the bottom piece broke. It was just the little snaps that keep the case on, but since the two at the back broke the case now slides forward off the computer. The top part still is functional. The same thing happened to the last snap on hard plastic case and this might just be a flaw of the design. The snap pieces are really tiny and easily broken. Another type of case is probably a better use of your money."
"on February 7, 2017","I'm not so crazy about the fact that it really covers the Apple logo, the keyboard pad you place on the keyboard doesn't seem very sturdy and moved around a lot when typing (not sure if that's suppose to happen?) It doesn't fit my keyboard the snug. I ordered the ""quarts rose"" which is pretty much a pink, cute color. I assume it does protect and does it's job, very easy to take on and off my MacBook Air."
"on October 1, 2017","I was in desperate need of a new hard case for my MacBook air - my other one was cracked. I really like this one - the color is a soft blush pink, which I love. The only bummer is that after a few months, the keyboard cover is driving me INSANE - it bubbles up in the middle of it. I use the cover to help keep one of my loose keys in place but the cover is so annoying that I'm going to get the key replaced ASAP so I can do without the keyboard cover."
"on December 1, 2016",This is a nice plastic case and I live the color! The keyboard cover is super cute!!! Nice quality for the price although the screen protecter for mine isn't great. The 2nd sticker that is supposed to be removed was a stubborn sticker and the excess is stuck on the corner of my screen. It also came with a card to help with air bubbles and it scratched my screen protecter super quick with not a lot of pressure. The case is great and so is the keyboard cover just disappointed in the screen protecter. Wondering if i can get there screen protecter replaced for free but not so sure.
"on February 8, 2017","The case works great but unfortunately, the key cover I received had a tear in it. It's still usable but that was a little disappointing. The screen protector works great and was easy to apply but it adds a bit of a glare if you're working outside on your laptop so I'll probably switch it out. For the price, I'd recommend this just because the case snaps on snug and keeps my computer clean, but those added bonuses are a bit cheap."
"on February 11, 2018","I bought this to cover and protect the outside of the actual computer, but surprisingly I really love the keyboard cover best. The actual cover that goes over the computer falls off often, so not sure if I’ll be be keeping it. The actual plastic case snaps in nicely and it seems ok for a short while, then when I open the computer it pops off."
"on December 31, 2016","I received the case this morning-- I ordered mine in Frost Clear. I expected my keyboard cover to come in the white color, as shown in the picture. However, it came with a very thin clear plastic keyboard cover instead. It is not the usual silicone keyboard cover that most companies make-- it feels very cheap. I am not sure if this was accidentally included in my order, or if the picture was just misleading. Additionally, the case came with a distinct black streak in the bottom corner of the top piece- I tried cleaning it off with no luck. Having a black streak in a clear case seems to defeat the effect I was going for. This is not my first purchase from Mosiso- I previously had their case in Rose Quartz. I was unpleasantly surprised when opening my second order after noting these issues, however, cannot complain too much because it's a decent price."
"on August 9, 2017","It's a nice case, it fits perfectly and the color was exactly what I was expecting. The only problem I'm having with this case is that it weighs down my lap top ALOT. I'm not sure why this piece of plastic adds so much weight, but if I'm holding my laptop and walking it makes my screen open all the way backwards. It also makes it feel a lot heavier in my hands. I'll probably end up switching out this case for a laptop skin, just so it won't be so weighed down."
"on August 11, 2017","I really wanted to like this case but I am unable to get over the ""fit"" of the cover. The case's color was great as well as the texture, and although some have said the case adds a noticeable weight to the MacBook, to me it's negligible. However, the means of securing the case to the laptop itself need improving. The lid portion has only 5 attachment tabs that run along the horizontal axis. When opening the laptop the case has a tendency of popping off due to the tabs not securely keeping it in place. This applies to the lower portion as well. The tabs that run along the bottom of the keyboard, where the wrists rest, will pop off while typing. I'm hoping this was a defect in the mold and has been corrected. If the case stayed on I'd give it 5 stars."
"on February 4, 2017","I got the lap top case in rose quartz, and I love it! It's a pale, light pink and it's unobtrusive while also giving my computer some character. The keyboard cover is great--it fits the keyboard perfectly, not too big not too small. I haven't used the screen protector, so I have no comment about that. I really the texture of the case, which is a kind of velvety feel compared to other hard shell laptop covers. UPDATING A FEW MONTHS LATER: the quality is very poor. The tabs holding the case onto the laptop have broken, so the case no longer attaches to the computer, rending it useless :/ I just had to throw it away. Given the price, I guess you get what you pay for! Still a reasonable purchase though"
"on April 8, 2017","Very true to color. When you first get it it seems a little to light but after getting it on it looks better. The only thing is immediately after taking it out of the box there was a chipped peice missing off the bottom and a 1inch crack connecting to it. The box was in perfect condition with no indication of it having been dropped or mistreated. I was super excited to get the case so when I realized I order the wrong size I was devastated. I was looking through so many options that when I finally decided on this one after the like 50th time, I forgot to recheck the size. So always check! Because of the crack I would have had to return it anyway, even if I had gotten the right size. That was pretty disappointing."
"on March 28, 2017","It is a very cheap case that works ok for the price.  Both the upper and lower case pop off easily, and I must be careful carrying, for fear of the macbook falling out of the case.For being very cheap and fulfilling the necessities: buenoFor being in fear of it falling off: no buenoIt's your decision if the trade off is worth it for you."
"on March 13, 2017","Clear case fits a macbook air pefectly. They keyboard cover doesn't lay flat and makes the keys feel mushy. I won't be using it. The screen protector went onto a brand new screen and was rife with bubbles that could not be removed. I'm no stranger to screen protectors and this was just awful. It was difficult to remove the screen protector once I decided I hated it. Furthermore, there were no instructions."
"on November 21, 2017","When I first got this I was attracted by the color and the price. It was true to color and easy to place on my Mac. However as time progressed I could tell why it was so cheap the bottom clasp broke off and the bottom stickers came off with a simple tap. To add on to the fact the case got really dirty in about two weeks and it was in a white case carrier so there was no excuse. Thankfully I was just using this until I finally got my Apple case, but if you’re wanting this for long term it’s only going to last for about 3 months until you have to buy a new one. In short while it does come with some nice additional perks it’s best if you just go buy a legit one."
"on February 17, 2017","Okay so I was pretty excited for this case but when I got it, it came with NO KEYBOARD COVER and that's what I was really waiting for because I really don't want my keys to get dirty and it didn't even come with one when it's supposed to. I contacted the seller about it and I still haven't heard from them (it's been a week). also its pretty black in the description picture but it's not really like that at all in reality; It's like a dusty black/dark greyish color and if you touch your computer a lot with your hands you can see the print marks on the case. Overall I hate to say it, but this case was a major disappointment, I think you can definitely find a better case on here for the same price if not cheaper."
"on June 25, 2017","Unfortunately, this case did not meet the same quality standards for me as it did for other reviewers. I bought based on other reviews but came away  disappointed. Yes, you get what you pay for...and next time I will pay more for a better product.The keyboard protector was sticky and made typing on it uncomfortable. I am no longer using it. The screen protector had air bubbles, even after I used the included tool to wipe them away. I ended up throwing that out too.The top case has stayed on but sometimes the bottom case falls off, even though it is snapped on."
"on January 5, 2017","It's definately not the best thing you can buy but it'll get the job done. My biggest complaint is that it fits great on top but on the bottom it's just slightly loose, like just enough to drive you mad if you're really OCD about things like that. I think it's probably more that there's no hook or attachment on the screen side so there's nothing really stopping it from moving. That being said I tied string around the bottom case and the hinge to keep it from moving and it works just fine now.Essentially this is a middle of the road case, if you want a cheap case this is fine. I do love the color it's light enough to not be in you're face but it still looks nice.Also just a side note: If you plan on putting decals on your computer under the case they're not going to be seen properly unless it's like black because it's a matte case and not a clear one."
"on May 7, 2017","I was so pleased with the case and the keyboard cover, it helps so much! The case itself has a nice feel but is super think plastic. After 3 months, the case had one of the corners chip off for no reason. I'll spend the extra cash next time"
"on October 7, 2017","The case is perfect. The keyboard cover smelled funny for a week, may be smell of paint and rubber. Screen gaurd is small. It can be a little bit bigger. The case perfectly protects Mac and It looks so good.But the case I received is a little damaged. In the bottom case one side is damaged may be in shipping. But kept the case because I don’t want to keep my Mac unprotected any longer."
"on October 22, 2017","One of the clips over the edge on the right side is sharp, like razor sharp. I filed it down a little, but feel like I shouldn't have to. Bottom has a small crack in it and white little feet have all fallen off, I substituted felt furniture tabs."
"on December 15, 2017","Bottom case doesn't fit very well at all, and I couldn't get the screen cover on to save my life. The keyboard cover is also a bit awkward until you get used to it. It is, however, very cute, so I still use it. Not a great buy, though. I would move on."
"on September 25, 2017","I liked how well this cover is compared to some of the other brands on here. My previous cover was for my Macbook Pro 2012 in which the other brand's cover damaged my computer. I was hesitant to get another case since then but I'm glad I got this one. There are no damages to my computer so far and I'm glad they gave me a screen protector and a keyboard case.However, I gave this product 3 stars because the case is already damages and I bought it about 10 days ago. It would be nice to speak to a representative about this because it is a plastic cover so it is prone to break easily."
"on January 18, 2018","I recently bought a black cover for my MacBook Air and the quality was nice. At first I liked the feel of it but after a couple hours of usage I noticed a lot of fingerprints. That was the big issue for me. It’s not very easy to clean and I saw that many other customers dealt with the same issue. After my first order, I decided to try out the clear hard plastic case. I love this new case but I bumped the rating down to three stars because of my previous bad experience with the black case."
"on July 26, 2017","It would be better to buy another bundle or just the case. The case is great, great color, easy to put on (just follow the instructions and like common sense) but the other elements that come with are not great. The screen protector is too small and the keyboard cover is just not right for the MacBook air. I don't recommend it, but it's not that bad. The colors are nice and the feel is good."
"on September 27, 2017","This is just okay.  The top doesn't stay on at all.  The bottom does and I like that it helps ventilate the computer while I'm working. It's kinda hard to get use to the covered keyboard cause it doesn't fit tight, so you never press some keys."
"on October 11, 2017","Was a good case for about 6 months, then the plastic clips that keep the case attached began to crack.I don't really throw my computer around, but its possible that it cracked while being transported in my laptop bag."
"on June 13, 2017","I like the case, but the keyboard cover should be made differently, it feels weird even having it on, so I just take it off.. it would be super cute If I could have it on, but it doesn't fit completely on the keys or something, so I have to press firmly to even type.."
"on February 1, 2018","The plastic hard case gets scratched very easily. And I recieved mine with one or two scratches with it on already. I bought a new book bag with very good padding for my laptop and whenever I take it out the bag it has scratches on the plastic hard case. And also another thing when I recieved the item, the keyboard protector lettering was coming off already on some of the keys. But I’m still going to use it cause I don’t want my laptop getting scratched but it seems very cheap. But you get what you pay for."
"on December 4, 2017","Everything was correct in the package except the plastic for the back of the screen was for the 11in. model not the 13in. The black plastic for the bottom of the laptop was the correct size and all the other contents were correct though. The 3 stars is because the wrong size was included, otherwise I like the case a lot, especially all the accessories that it includes for a price way cheaper than Speck, plus it has lasted pretty long compared to Speck when I bought it previously. Going to return and hope for the proper sizes next time I order."
"on February 8, 2018","I bought this case because I wanted to protect my brand new laptop about four months ago, and not only did the bottom of the case start falling apart my laptop was not fully protected either. This is a good deal for a case but the bottom part has continued to give me problems since about a month after I bought it. The clips that hold it on are breaking and the white stands on the bottom have fallen off making my laptop wobbly. I do not recommend this case unless you just need to top part of it."
"on August 7, 2017","Looks very nice as described, the screen protector very good quality, but the keyboard protector keeps popping off, and the material of the case gets fingerprints marks all the time, just by touching or grabbing it."
"on January 15, 2018","The color is beautiful, and the case fit my 13"" MacBook Air perfectly.  The keyboard cover, however, covered all of the keys pretty well except for the function keys. For some reason, it only covered the bottom half of those keys. It was almost like someone had cut off too much from the top. That's the actual design, though, as I can see now from the picture. I wish I'd looked more closely at the picture of the keyboard cover before ordering..."
"on December 2, 2017","The keyboard and screen protector are ok, but the case looks a little like cheap plastic and the color is the same solid over the apple logo. The logo its barely visible when the laptop is on. I was ready to return it as soon as I opened it, but I don't wanna deal with the hassle of waiting for them to receive it to get the money back, and I need the laptop to be protected ASAP. If you have not issue with the logo being covered then go ahead. I gotta say that it is a perfect fit and the color looks nice."
"on February 13, 2017","I really like this case.  It's very pretty and it came with extra nubbins for the bottom, which is awesome because I find that they can fall off easily.  But within the first week of having it the bottom cracked and it continues to crack more.  It happened to my old case (which was purchased from a different seller at the same price) after three years of having it, but with this one it happened within the first week.  Made me really sad because it is so pretty.  The bottom will barely stay on.  Really sad. :("
"on October 3, 2017","Just got this. Cute and feminine. It is matte, so suspect dirt will show. The fit  and application couldn't be better, clips right on and stays in place. LOVE it!"
"on July 8, 2017","You get what you pay for with this one. I like the color but it wasn't really a snug fit for my 13-inch Mac Air...and I triple checked the model to make sure I got the correct size. The top cover would come off quite a bit because the teeth don't quite latch on the top edge. Thought I wasn't putting it correctly but even when my son and then my daughter did it for me, it would still come off periodically. But it was cheap and it does protect my mac even if I have to re-attach the top cover every now and then..."
"on March 23, 2017",Screen protecter and Keyboard cover work great. The hard case was difficult to put on and the top part broke after being on for just 2 weeks. Now I have to purchase a new one.. Color looked just like pictured.
"on April 16, 2017","This was beautiful, until it got a spot of lotion on it and nothing would take it off.  I tried water, rubbing alcohol  as suggested, vinegar and water as suggested etc.  it just made it worse. Luckily someone suggested using a credit card with no embossing on it to remove it. I tried everything to clean it, and unfortunately nothing worked. I'm giving it three stars because it was great for 48 hours."
"on April 24, 2017","I purchased this for my laptop, very beautiful color, you can see the Apple logo when lighted. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars, is due to the fact the Hard Case kept slipping off my laptop from time to time, having me take time to readjust it.. Also, it kept breaking off pieces from all around the edges. I only have the top cover on it now. & I treat all my belongings carefully, I do not know why it broke so soon & easily."
"on May 24, 2017","Cover fits well so far and is very minimal. Nice feel and color. I did not receive the keyboard cover or screen cover, however."
"on March 20, 2017","It feels very ""plastic-e"" I wasn't very happy with it, luckily I got another case which I love and use for my brand new Mac. This case also feels a it rough on the inside, makes me think that it would scratch the Macs surface. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the fast delivery and because of the keyboard cover"
"on January 16, 2018","I just got this case today, so we will see how it holds up over the coming days. The case was fairly easy to put on. I wasn’t sure which way the top goes on, so I put the part with 2 clips on the front (where you open the computer). Not sure if that’s correct. The keyboard cover has a little defect on both the space bar and caps lock button. And, my screen protector was already dusty. Not sure if I’ll put it on. Not bad, could be better."
"on February 5, 2018","I really liked the cover however, the cover arrived chipped on the side so I’d probably try ordering from another company next time."
"on January 31, 2018","I got this case back in July, so it has been quite awhile now. I loved it at first, it fits my Macbook air perfect but not very long lasting at all. It has cracks all over and it seems to be not serving it's purpose anymore. Again, I have had it for awhile now but I thought it would last longer than this. I guess not for the price."
"on December 14, 2016","**UPDATE**Case isn't very durable. Pieces have continued to break off, but I guess I can't complain for the price I paid.**I enjoyed this product. I haven't used the screen protector - I don't normally use them for any products so my review does not reflect the screen protector.The case and keyboard cover were easy to install on my Mac. Unfortunately, the bottom case was cracked in the corner when I received it. It's still functional, but it stinks when you buy something and it arrives less than perfect."
"on February 28, 2017","I loved the color! , perhaps I did not ready the description throughly before buying but the cover is matte which for now it's nice and clean and hopefully it stays like that. The keyboard is nice. I don't like that the apple doesn't really show but I'll live with that. It is very plastic like. I am not in love with the material that is why I am giving it 3 stars"
"on December 31, 2017","Love the color. Case is fine, until I tried to remove it to clean it and it broke all over the place :( now I just keep it on my computer to prevent further damage."
"on January 25, 2018",it picks up greasy and all the feet fell off. it's only been a couple of months. if i knew this would happen i would have just bought the speck case.
"on July 17, 2017","I don't like the quality of the plastic. I have purchased this brand before but in lavender and it chipped within two weeks. I wanted to give this company another chance since I liked the idea of mint green but smudges are easily noticeable and hard to clean. Overall, it you want something that will last about a month then this is the case to purchase."
"on January 19, 2018",What I liked the most about this case its that it brings everything that you asked from the color to the screen protector. The thing I disliked about the case it’s that it was poorly packaged and I wish it came with two screen protectors just in case the first one gets messed up while putting it on your computer screen.
"on June 9, 2017",I really did love this case at first. Color is great. But lately the top keeps popping off. Cannot get it to stay on. Wish I could return.
"on January 9, 2018",It's a decent quality case. It's pretty easy to put on. The keyboard cover is a little hard to type with but that's to be expected. I gave three stars because the letters on the cover don't line up with the letters on the actual keyboard.
"on December 25, 2016","I really like the color of this case, but I wanted it to be more transparent like it seems to be in the picture. It's a bit darker in person and I think it makes the case look a different color than what is pictured. It fits well though, and protects the computer as expected from a case like this. The apple logo does show through when open, but not super bright. I would possibly buy this again in a different color."
"on December 30, 2016","Its not as vibrant as it looks, and the apple light logo on my MacBook Air looks weird. The keyboard cover isn't awesome but that could just be me, this is my first time using one. The screen protector was easy to use and no bubbles and great, but there is a slight glare.Overall for the price and what it offers in protection of my MacBook I give it 3 stars. But I'm disappointed in the color for sure."
"on February 7, 2017","The first month that I had this product it didn't give me any problems. After a while, i noticed that the sides started to break and fall off. This product's appearance is just what you expect. It has a smooth look and feel to it, but the overall quality isn't as advertised. I'm constantly take my laptop in and out of my bag so I need something that is sturdy enough and this product didn't mean my expectations."
"on September 22, 2017","I have used the hard case for approximately 6 months. Right from the beginning, the screen protector was not really useful, since it formed a lot of bubbles. The case started presenting flaws in the first two months, and now it is basically falling apart, even though I carry my notebook only inside another case. The keyboard protector looks pretty good on my notebook, though. It was cheap, but the reviews were a bit misleading"
"on April 28, 2017",Started breaking even with diligent care after 2 months. There are better cases out there.
"on January 2, 2018","I bought this case and keyboard cover for the purpose of protecting my Macbook from oily finger stains. The keyboard cover does this well, but the case is covered in oil marks which left me really disappointed. The screen protector is difficult to install and leaves air bubble no matter how much you try to squeegee the bubbles out so I just ended up taking it off."
"on January 11, 2017","So, I've had a few Mosiso laptop cases before, and they were always great! This case is okay, but on the bottom piece, it curves away from the thin/forward corners of my macbook air. The keyboard cover fits excellently, but it muffles sound more than others I've had, and I couldn't get the screen protector on for the life of me. The top half of the case fits great though, and the color is beautiful!"
"on January 2, 2018","This product is good for the cheap price. The case fits well and is very cute. But if you’re looking for something more protective for your computer you should consider a heavy duty case, because this case will provide little to no protection. Mostly just protection against scratches. If you’re looking for a cute case this is your product, but if you’re looking for protection then look elsewhere!"
"on January 20, 2018",Don't use the screen protector. The keyboard cover slides off really easily. The case itself is nice but can pop of easily if bumped.
"on June 10, 2017","When I received it I couldn't wait to put it on my laptop.The case is really nice, loved the color and the keyboard cover fit nicley. Unfortunately, the portion that snaps on to secure the laptop broke after only a week. Now the bottom part of the case won't stay on. Was going to purchase a few more in different colors but Ill probably try a different brand."
"on July 31, 2017",The keyboard doesn't align and a piece already broke off.**Update: I've been using this for a few months now and the bottom already broke.
"on August 27, 2017","Mine came dirty, with a hair on the I side. It was also scratched  a little.Update: I’ve used this case for 16 weeks and it is decent. I’ve gotten some compliments on it too. I’m going to get a new one because it is scratched, but better it scratched than my laptop. It is great for the price. Also, the keyboard cover didn’t work for me because it was all wonky and didn’t fit on the keys."
"on May 16, 2017",The cover for the top of my laptop has a hard time staying securely clicked onto my computer. It is often trying to snap off when I open my computer.
"on November 26, 2017",Pretty good. The top and the keyboard cover have lasted me forever but the bottom hinge broke essentially immediately rendering it unusable. It just slid around constantly and became a huge nuisance so i chucked it.
"on July 1, 2017","Overall the cover is ok but not great. It looks very well once on but some of the hooks to click on the computer are a bit loose. The color I had ordered was lighter than the one I received so beware of that when buying. Moreover, the keyboard cover doesn't fit that well on the keyboard, it is a bit loose, so it is a challenge to type with it. The screen protector didn't stick to my computer screen so I ended up throwing it away."
"on June 7, 2017","Does it's job, my laptop feels much more protected. The bottom rubber pads slide off though, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. The keyboard cover doesn't truly fit and it doesn't allow the backlight to shine through (not see through!)."
"on February 16, 2018","This case got so dirty so easily. It showed all fingerprints. I only used it for about a week before I just took it off permanently. It is a good case, just not the best one I've tried. I would also do a different color than the mint."
"on March 29, 2017",This was a great buy the case itself fits my Macbook air perfectly. The screen protector was difficult to apply and not the best quality and I felt that the keyboard cover made it a bit difficult to type. Overall though it serves its purpose.
"on February 6, 2018",Like the color but i feel like i can’t heat the music loud how I use to with out it.
"on February 9, 2018",just opened this today and its okay. the color is good but the there was no receipt or anything to go along with it. the backs of the top and bottom pieces kind of rub up against each other so hopefully that doesn't ruin it. the keyboard was kind of a bonus but its kind of hard to see the letters when its dark but overall will probably continue to use.
"on September 15, 2017","Leaves fingerprint marks, difficult to clean."
"on October 7, 2017","I got this case after my last one (same case) cracked and all of the securing clips broke off after about a year. I figured that for the price it lasted long enough and I'd get the same thing. Unfortunately, this one doesn't seem to fit as well. It doesn't completely clip on at the bottom, and when I open the screen enough, it pushed the entire bottom section forward."
"on February 27, 2017",Its not fully transparent but you can still see the apple logo pretty okay. The keyboard cover is crap and I do NOT use it. I do however like the case so far. It seem sturdy and easy to snap on but the bottom snaps were a little more tricky than the top. Overall its an okay product but personally if I find a better case I will be buying that one and keeping this one as a backup.
"on December 21, 2017","The top always falls off, otherwise it does protect"
"on July 15, 2017","Great, matte look; however, the case didn't last even 6 months before it started cracking & pieces started breaking off. I mean, you get what you pay for. Will not be purchasing again, but it looked great while it lasted. Wouldn't recommend buying this product if you're looking for a long-lasting laptop case."
"on February 2, 2018",I really like the cases that Mosiso creates with all the different designs. However this particular one I received was cut wrong and it did not fit on my laptop correctly.
"on March 24, 2017","Arrived quickly, and looked just as I expected. I have loved using it and received a few compliments too. It came mid-October, but now it is March and it has not lasted. Starting a few months ago, I started seeing cracks and small pieces falling off the edge. I'm not very rough with my mac, but thought this may be due to normal wear/tear. This morning the two clips on the back of the top cover finally gave, rendering the case almost useless. I'm not sure about the life of the product in general, but was hoping to get more than six months use from it. Would still recommend given the price, looks, and protection it gave over the six months."
"on August 3, 2017",Worked great for 3 months then cracked near input openings on bottom portion of the case. Computer isn't even used but once maybe twice weekly. Short return policy. Cool color choices though!
"on October 10, 2017",The bottom buttons get removed by itself.
"on March 5, 2017","The bottom fits and stays on well but the top does not stay on at all. I wish I wouldn't have put the screen protector on because there are so many bubbles underneath it and it takes a long time to get them all out. It was a good price, but I see you get what you pay for."
"on December 8, 2017",Three because it did crack fairly easily.
"on March 9, 2017",Could not get it to snap on my MacBook and stay on. The keypad looked pretty but made it not as easy to type. All in all just ok
"on January 12, 2018","I ordered the mint color and everything looked like the picture. The only issue I had was putting the top cover on. I had to force the case on and the little latches on the cover look like they are about to break. Next time I would spend a little more money on a case, I’m not too sure how long this one will last."
"on October 26, 2017","Fit the right way... but the keyboard cover left marks on my screen, the screen protector didn't fit correctly and there was a glare of lights, the white rubber things on the bottom came off within a week and wouldn't stay on. Does the trick of protecting your computer, though."
"on November 8, 2017","Not the best quality, but the price"
"on November 10, 2017",I was highly disappointed in the quality the top part of the case was clean but the bottom part was dirty and it seemed to have water damage even tho it was brand new
"on August 27, 2017",I like the case but the bottom piece of the case doesn't fully snap on because the clasp is not big enough :/ was really excited for the new case and am disappointed with the fit. Mosiso Plastic Hard Case with Keyboard Cover with Screen Protector for MacBook Air 13 Inch
"on April 27, 2017","Looks great, but one tab broke off within a week :("
"on February 1, 2017","The keyboard protector silicone fits perfectly, and I love it, BUT... it blocks out my lighted MacBook keyboard."
"on April 12, 2017","Bottom part of the case does not stay on my laptop well, but the color is pretty and I like the keyboard cover. I wouldn't recommend this, however, because I'm sure there is another one on amazon that is a similar price that actually stays on the bottom part of the computer."
"on December 30, 2016","The color is awesome.  The top piece has popped off a few times, so I'm not sure how it would protect in a fall.  The keyboard feels a little ""gummy"" so it took me a minute to get used to typing with it on, but I've gotten used to it.  The screen protector was really hard to get smooth.  I have bubbles on mine."
"on June 28, 2017",The case was cracked on the corner. So I don't see it lasting too long. Also the top part of the case was SO hard to get onto my MacBook Air 2017. There are also no instructions. Overall it works for now!
"on January 30, 2017","For a $13 case, I'm not sure what I was expecting. The color is cute, the keyboard cover works well but I ordered it about a month and a half ago and it has already completely fallen apart, the tabs that keep the case on have all fallen off and the corner has completely chipped off. I am not rough with my computer, I have never even dropped it. Frustrating I already have to order a new case."
"on January 25, 2018",Everything was great until I opened the top piece to find a huge great scratch on it. I decided to just leave it since I added stickers to my case anyway.
"on January 17, 2018","Didn’t realize it will make the weight almost double and the keyboard cover isn’t completely flat, kind of warped. Trying to get used to with it anyway"
"on September 24, 2017",Case kept coming off by its self.
"on April 5, 2017","The color is nice, but it doesn't snap all the way on and a piece of it already broke off. Wouldn't buy again, but can't expect too much for something this inexpensive"
"on January 27, 2018","I bought the black case and it all fit fine, although I don't like using the keyboard cover. My complaint is that, no matter how clean my hands are, fingerprints will collect everywhere and you have to scrub them off with a moist towel"
"on September 2, 2017","The case works fine, but the keyboard cover for the Frost cover was terrible.  A friend of mine ordered the mint color and her keyboard cover was so much better.  Just okay...."
"on December 2, 2016","I could not get the top cover to stay. After multiple attempts, I FINALLY secured it. I have no idea how I did it, however, the bottom cover cracked in the corner after the top was secured. I love the color and the key board cover. It is fine for now. I wish it came with trouble shooting directions."
"on January 9, 2018","Would’ve goven this case 5 stars but when I got the case, the corner of the bottom piece was already broken and a pice just loose in the package. I absolutely love the color and feel of this case but I’m very disappointed that the reviews were true about them coming in already broken."
"on June 29, 2017","Beautiful product but it didn't fit.  I'mNot sure why.  It was a little too big.  We probably should've double checked the model.  Returning & refunding my money was a piece of cake! Will order another one, I just need to double check the model.  Still a good deal!:)"
"on November 13, 2016","I'm happy with the cover for now. I have to constantly click it back on to lock it into place, and the bottom will pop off if I slide my laptop across the table sometimes, depending on the surface. The actual color (green) isn't as bold as I thought it would be from looking at the pictures online."
"on February 14, 2018","its a nice cover, but it does not clip on right."
"on November 16, 2016","Case fits great, and looks nice. However, I needed to take the case off and it is almost impossible to remove it. In fact, when I tried it snapped. If you purchase this, make sure you want it to stay on forever because as soon as you remove it it will break. I have only had the case for 2 weeks."
"on January 19, 2017",The color is really pretty and looks like it's made well! Only problem I was when I was taking it out of the package a piece broke off. But it doesn't affect how it clips on. The bottom piece is perfect but I feel like the top piece doesn't stay on very well. Pretty good for the price!
"on January 1, 2018",Keyboard part is nice but the top cover always falls off.
"on June 15, 2017",More translucent than I thought it would be and also came slightly cracked on the side but it isn't really noticeable and did not affect how it fit my laptop.
"on June 13, 2017","The color is actually a lighter pink than the image shows and doesn't stay in for me, I have to constantly pop it back on. The keyboard cover muffles the speaker within the keyboard so unfortunately I had to take it off."
"on June 1, 2017",I bought this in black but it turned out to be more gray. Not as opaque as shown in the picture.Quality so far seems good. Doesn't snap on too snug but it doesnt fall off.
"on December 28, 2016",Everyone was nice with the case it's self. The complaint I have is the screen protector does not cover the full screen there is a boarder around it. Also the keyboard protector makes it really hard to see the actually letters on the keyboard which my niece was unhappy with.
"on February 7, 2017","This case did not fit perfectly onto my laptop, some spots on the bottom half feel loose. Also, the rubber feet on the bottom were not glued on correctly, 3 of the 4 were uneven. Lastly, the screen protector that came with it was damaged and bent."
"on May 30, 2017",Heavy cover.
"on July 20, 2017",More transparent then I wanted. It was nice for a few days but then picked up a crazy amount of dirt. It quickly became and ugly color and did not last very long. I would suggest this case if you need protection but not if you care about looks.
"on November 17, 2017","Snaps in place easily, but hard to get off. The sides cracked off within months and when I tried to take it off temporarily, it cracked from one of the top corners"
"on April 3, 2017",It's good
"on October 3, 2017",Good
"on January 23, 2018",I enjoy the color and the texture of the case! I've bought the same case in different color and never had problem. But with this one the bottom part does not seem to fit correctly and feels like it can come off easily at any time. Other than that i do recommend !
"on September 21, 2017",The case itself is fine (however it arrived with a chipped edge)... the keyboard cover does what it's supposed to do... the screen protector seems impossible to apply without air bubbles or dust getting on it.
"on January 15, 2018","The cover fits perfectly but the keypad cover does not line up, causing the keys to look blurry when lit up. The power button is the most different key. I have a brand new MacBook Air. And the model is the model that is posted that they say fits."
"on October 23, 2017","It's a pretty great case, if you wanted a completely full coverage glossy finish. I however was under the impression that the apple sign would still show so I could show everyone that I was their superior...but I guess that's not the case, which is why I'll be returning it."
"on August 15, 2017","I bought this to protect my laptop and put stickers on. The keyboard cover is great. The bottom tends to detach, and it's not comfortable as it digs into your arm if you place your forearm on top of it. The top has stayed on well."
"on October 30, 2017","Loved the color and the keyboard cover. The actual shell, however, cracked in a few months of it being on my laptop. While it was on there, though, I loved the color and feel of it."
"on November 21, 2017","Just received mine today. The top portion fits well, but unfortunately the bottom doesn’t snap on all the way. I have bought this brand a few times for my MacBook Air, but all eventually break after a year. Not surprising with how cheap they are."
"on February 15, 2018","for top panel, left side doesnt have complete cover. Right side is ok. When we carry around, felt macbook is heavier than earlier. Not sure how much, but definitely this cover is heavy. for this price, i would say this is ok."
"on December 6, 2017",Computer case is great!Keyboard cover not so great...letters are difficult to see on the keyboard cover- light does not shine through where the letters are- the light pink and white do not provide enough contrast.
"on February 4, 2018","I wouldn't say it fits perfectly, but for the price its very cute. there is some trouble using headphones while its on though"
"on March 15, 2017","The case was really pretty and arrived quickly. But not a day with the case and the paint was already fading off. The keyboard cover is a little off, but for the price can't complain much. Would not order again though."
"on October 13, 2017",Overall a good product. Gets dirty fast and is hard to clean.
"on July 28, 2017",Good cheap laptop protector. I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with a keyboard protector. The only downside is that the case retains finger stains.
"on June 23, 2017","The order I placed was for a gold case, this color is rose gold. Durable and snaps in place. Keycover is in the actual gold I wanted. cover and case two different colors."
"on January 13, 2017",Item is more of a clear black... or even grey color. Already had a small crack in top case before I put it on. Other than that it seems good. The key cover is nice as well.
"on October 7, 2017","Great color, but it leaves fingertips every time you touch it. So, you have to constantly clean it. Also, the screen protector that comes with it does not fit the screen, it's too small"
"on September 14, 2017",Feels and looks a bit flimsy and cheap. Not impressed.
"on October 6, 2017",It came cracked and the top and bottom were different colors.
"on May 15, 2017","The case fit perfectly, as well as the keyboard cover. However!! The bottom half of the case cracked in the first couple of days, and the little grips on the bottom have also fallen off in the first couple of days as well."
"on December 16, 2016","The bottom case did not fit my MacBook Air 13.3 in the top did perfectly. Not sure why that is. Other than that I like the product , it was just as described but just wish they got the dimensions right since my case doesn't fit properly."
"on March 29, 2017","The color was true to the advertisement and the product was easy to put on, however, the keyboard cover slips off constantly while typing and looks very cheaply made compares to others I have seen on my friend's laptop."
"on January 16, 2018",Bottom snaps come undone very easily. I have a macbook air 2016.
"on October 18, 2017","The top piece of the cover does not fit perfectly and was extremely hard to force onto my laptop. Eventually, it cracked trying to put it on. After a few months of use, one of the bottom rubberized pegs to prevent slipping fell off."
"on July 5, 2017","Great case for the price, it seems pretty well made. Didn't come with the keyboard cover as advertised."
"on February 15, 2018","It’s a great case ! Just sad it’s already broken in a few pieces , so I wouldnt  say it’s sturdy , it was caught on my backpack so the bottom piece broke and idk thought it was a pretty strong plastic"
"on September 29, 2017","Good case, but it showed up cracked on one of the corners. Not enough to to send back, but enough to not fit right."
"on August 30, 2017","The top part of the case fits super well, but it has a bit of an awkward fit on the bottom part. It doesn't completely cover the front edges and is a little short on the back. I do feel safer with it on, though."
"on September 1, 2017",The keyboard cover is great. It took a while to snap the top cover on. The only thing I don't like is that the edges of the bottom cover are sharp and can be annoying and abrasive when typing
"on September 26, 2017","The case fits well, my only complaint being a small crack that is on the corner of the case. This could have derived from shipping, but nevertheless the case serves its purpose."
"on January 10, 2017","The outer cover is great.  I used the keyboard cover for about a week and removed it.  It covers the backlight for the keys  and diminishes the response of the keys. On a positive note, the keyboard cover keeps crumbs out!"
"on January 20, 2018",you get what you paid for
"on November 26, 2017","Great quality, the only down side is that it is hard to take off, still have not figured out an easy way to take it off!"
"on July 15, 2017",This is okay. The case and key cover fits well. It's just that the screen protector doesn't fit my mac. It's a touch too small so there's a little bit of extra space that is not protected.
"on August 30, 2017",My case came good in the package but the only thing is that it doesn't stay on the computer I have to keep clipping it back on every time I touch my computer. I'm not really sure if one of the little hooks are broken .
"on November 14, 2016",the case fits well for my MacBook Air but the keyboard cover prevents the backlight from shining. Was disappointed in that as I really wanted a keyboard protector and feel as though I could've made purchase with another seller.
"on March 19, 2017","The product fits, but I feel like it's not a secure fit. When I open my laptop it feels like the cover is coming loose. The corners in particular are what feel loose.Esthetically, the product is nice. Looks and feels great on the MacBook Air. Fast delivery with no issues."
"on April 2, 2017","IT'S alright. Not too bad, not too good."
"on February 16, 2017",This is a very nice case a pretty color. However it cracked from just me pulling it out of my backpack. It cracked exactly the same on both sides identically so I'm not sure if it's the shape or what but it only last a few weeks2nd picture is the line of the crack that has come off yet
"on September 15, 2017","Everything was fine, except there were no instructions on how to fit the screen protector and since it isn't a sticky one that gets pasted on, I did not know what to do with it and ended up having to throw it away."
"on October 7, 2017","Ordered the black, ended up looking more navy. I still like the color so not a huge deal. Also shows finger prints pretty easily and slides a bit as if its not fully secure on the laptop."
"on January 24, 2018","I love the color and feel of this case. However, it doesn't fit perfectly. the bottom half does not snap on all the way making it pretty annoying to use."
"on June 27, 2017",The corners of the case cracked easily. I'm not rough on my laptop at all.
"on October 23, 2017","The case itself is great quality and I love the colors. That being said, I wish it would stay on my laptop. The bottom cover doesn’t move but the one that goes on the screen portion is constantly falling over."
"on August 24, 2017",the color is not like the picture at all. its more of a purple and the keyboard cover is brown red. Also the top case is extremely hard to take off.
"on January 23, 2018",makes the laptop much heavier and it broke in some areas. the apple logo isn’t that visible as it is in the picture. cheap.
"on August 5, 2017",Love the color but when the bottom part of the case is on it is very uncomfortable to type on my laptop. The edge is alway scratching poking at my wrist. I ended up taking the bottom off just so I could use my computer.
"on February 17, 2018","the keyboard cover was bent so out of shape i can't use it properly on my laptop, its got wrinkles and it just doesn't sit right, other than that pretty straight forward."
"on December 27, 2016",I like it fine -- glad I bought it.The one problem I've had is that the feet come off the bottom.
"on January 11, 2018","Wish there was an option to only buy the cover, and not the keyboard part. Other than that, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their laptop without it feeling bulky in the process."
"on December 2, 2017","Product functioned just fine, but the masala red color is nothing like the color that I got, which in person was quite orange."
"on December 19, 2017",The key board cover had a pink mark that couldn’t be cleaned near the space bar. Looked like a spillage of some sort and wasn’t supposed to be there. Other then that fitment was good.
"on January 8, 2018","When first opened, has a pungent smell. Smell dies down after about a week of letting it air out in front of a window. Then case and protector works well. You can NOT see keyboard backlit..."
"on November 3, 2017",Case fit a little lose. It clips on to my computer just fine but I can pull the sides and stick part of my finger through the space. It's not a terrible buy but I'm also not super happy about it.
"on November 19, 2016",It's pretty but doesn't really fit the computer properly. But for the price it's fine.
"on February 14, 2018",While I love the color it doesn’t snap to my MacBook. Three stars because the bottom cover isn’t snapped in completely.
"on June 1, 2017","came with a lot of items but the top case is nots so good, I expected the apple logo section to be transparent but it is not, so the apple logo is so dark and almost invisible."
"on January 19, 2018",It’s too tight for MacBook Air. My daughter is having a hard time removing the cover. She has no choice but to use it.
"on November 30, 2017",The case is ok. It doesn’t snap on easily and comes off sometimes. The color looks like the picture. The keyboard cover is the best. It does not move and is easy to type on.
"on January 19, 2017","Good case, fits on MacBook air well. Very good grip on tables.The color looks good as well. And very ventilated.My only issue is at the bottom of the case where your wrist rests, theres no clips holding the MacBook air in place."
"on March 31, 2017","Color is nice, but the fit was a little off for my laptop, particularly the piece that fits to the top. Hard to put on, and pieces of it cracked when it did. Disappointing, but the bottom piece is fine and I like the screen protector."
"on November 3, 2016",It looked great and was exactly what I wanted. As I placed my MacBook into its case part of the case broke off. I applied little to no force when this happened which makes me question the integrity of the plastic. However it was still functional so I am continuing to use it.
"on December 22, 2017","Its a good case, very pretty. Unfortunately, mine came a little chipped and the bottom part wouldn't snap all the way. It still worked though"
"on December 6, 2017",I liked it BUT...It picked up transfer from the inside of my black jansport making the corners of it al black.
"on December 5, 2016","At first I thought the product worked well. However, after about a month, pieces started easily breaking off. I keep my laptop in a zipped case inside my laptop bag, so it's well protected (thus, no way for the case to break due to it hitting anything). Disappointed."
"on September 8, 2017","Case is okay, except the rubber stickers at the bottom that are supposed to be used to keep it from sliding came off inside of my laptop bag. other than that it is a great product!"
"on August 30, 2017",I bought this for my son's laptop.  The case is made fairly cheap.  Two corners have already cracked and broken off.  The keyboard park works great. This is ok for the price.
"on May 14, 2017","Pretty good, I can't get the top to fit properly on the top of my computer though."
"on April 27, 2017",The case feels very cheap. Too pink! ILiked the keypad cover better than the actual case!
"on October 2, 2016",I'm not a fan of the color. It seemed to be a warmer tone on the screen. However the texture of the key board is nice and the machine is protected. I wish I'd ordered a different color.
"on January 30, 2017","The case is really cute, but it does not stay on the computer very well. I would suggest you buy a different case, because it constantly falls off of my MacBook Air."
"on September 28, 2017",When I receive my package everything was fine till I opened it. My screen protector was folded n I couldn’t use it. Other the that the case was good.
"on February 28, 2017","it does the job , protect but the clasps broke at the top on both sides where it should keep case on so now it no longer keeps top on."
"on August 15, 2017",The case broke when I put it on my computer. It falls off even though it's the right size. It's able to stay on after I adjust it a few times.  I love the color.
"on March 25, 2017","The case is extremely cute and i really love the color, however it doesn't really fit my laptop. I have a macbook air 13in, which should be the correct fit, but the case always seems to fall off."
"on January 23, 2017",the cover keeps falling off here and there and the keyboard is super duper soft so thats a plus. It makes me type slower though. But other than that its okay :)
"on September 24, 2017","When this case came in, little pieces of it were broken off. Obviously this case was cheap so I wasn’t surprised but I was a bit upset about HOW cheap it was."
"on February 6, 2017","Very nice cover who did it's purpose for the first two to three weeks. However, it broke on several spots even though I didn't drop it and only carried it in my bag. But given the price probably to expect"
"on December 25, 2017","Falls off, super fragile."
"on January 16, 2018",I like to be color and the durability of the case but it doesn’t fit the bottom half of the computer that great. Still a little too big and slides around
"on February 2, 2017",The case is fairly good. I didn't receive the clear screen protector and the case gets dirty really fast and there's no way of getting stains off of it.
"on January 9, 2017","The screen protector was a little too large for the screen, and I the lid piece has scrapes on the edge like it was not finished properly. Everything else is fine."
"on July 23, 2017",The top/bottom right of the upper part of the case do not fully snap on. If you snap on the top right then the bottom right won't be on and vice versa.
"on December 18, 2016","the fit for the case is good, but the screen protector is a bit small for the screen. overall its a decent product and i would get it again if needed."
"on December 16, 2017",Nice cover fits well as does the keyboard
"on May 14, 2017","It seems durable. I liked the keyboard cover also, but the Hard case did not fit FLUSH on my mac.  One corner did NOT completely close."
"on November 3, 2017","Really nice color and good quality, but adds a lot of weight to my Macbook Air."
"on January 29, 2018","I love everything about the protection of it, but the screen protector doesn't exactly fit, and its really easy to get fingerprints."
"on August 23, 2017","the top comes off very easily, the bottom, keyboard cover, and screen protector are great"
"on January 12, 2017","Good buy. Nice color, protects my MacBook and inexpensive. Screen protector part does cause screen to be heavy and lean back farther than normal."
"on January 30, 2018",The black color is kind of an off-black. Almost looks like a dark navy or gray so I was a little disappointed but I still like it.
"on September 5, 2017",I ordered the case in black and I just received the case. The case fits good but I did not receive the screen protector nor the keyboard cover.
"on June 12, 2017","It is a cool cover for my laptop but it came broken when i got it, other than that its a good cover"
"on January 11, 2017",it's a decent case but the top part doesn't snap onto my macbook air properly. the top just falls off occasionally which can get annoying.
"on November 9, 2016",It's nice and keeps my computer from scuffing or getting cosmetic blemishes. But.... this turned out to be a metallic pink than a rose gold and that was a let down.
"on July 21, 2017","I like the product and everything fits, only problem is that the color is not as displayed, definately a lighter color."
"on August 18, 2017","I received the top and bottom cover, as well as the keyboard cover, but did not get a screen protector. How do I resolve this issue?"
"on March 7, 2017","The case is fine, however the logo doesn't show well like the picture does. The slip cover that goes on the keys gets in the way so I just don't use it. Other than that it's a good case."
"on September 3, 2017","Although it's still nice, definitely not as black as the picture. More of a dark grey"
"on February 8, 2017","I love the colour. However, after a few days of using, there were multiple scratches on the case that causes the colour to disappear"
"on December 17, 2017","First month of having it was great, but the bottom corners of the case are already broken off. Cute, but cheap"
"on July 19, 2017",It broke and didn't fit my computer right
"on April 29, 2017","i wouldnt recomend putting on thescreen protecto, and the keyboard cover broke within a week."
"on February 3, 2018",a case is nice but I don't like​ the color because it's kind of different than in the picture.
"on January 28, 2017","Its alright, but it shows a lot of fingerprints. Be prepared to clean it a lot if you don't want the fingerprints to show!"
"on January 3, 2018",The quality is not great. It'll break within a couple of months.
"on December 20, 2016","The top of the case does tend to pop off occasionally. It snaps back on but, eventually, pops off again. The bottom and the keyboard cover are fine."
"on September 28, 2017",The product has a crack on the right bottom side.
"on February 6, 2018",Never received key board cover nor the screen protector.But did get the case which is pretty good.
"on January 25, 2018",It started to crack in the areas that snap onto the lapto. Otherwise it’s cute.
"on October 6, 2017","Case is perfect. However the shipment did not come with a keyboard protector as advertised, a little bit disappointed."
"on June 6, 2017",Fix the labtop perfectly. I didn't like the color. The color is lighter than the picture.
"on November 24, 2016","The bottom part kept slipping and it didn't completely cover the edges, but I still really like the color and the keyboard."
"on October 21, 2017",The keyboard piece was ripped when we got it but the plastic hard case seems durable so it’s good for a cheap price
"on December 25, 2017",After just a few months the case does not remain secure. It is also slightly flimsier than I had anticipated.
"on October 26, 2017",Everything is great except that it gets stuck tightly  which makes me unable to grab it off even I hurt my nail!
"on January 21, 2017",The color on the plastic cover for the keyboard fades after a while... But it is a good sturdy cover for the price.
"on January 19, 2018",Its very nice. The three stars because I received my case scratched!
"on May 16, 2017","It's alright, however the bottom part on the right side keeps coming off. I have to constantly snap it back in but it doesn't stay there for long."
"on February 6, 2018",fair price..
"on February 7, 2017","Dont really like the way it fits, one of the little clips that hold it on to the top of the laptop was halfway broken so it doesn't stay on so well."
"on January 17, 2018","Really cute case, but broke apart within a month."
"on November 10, 2016","The case fit a little odd, and every time I would open my MacBook, the case would catch and make a clicking sound. I was going to send it back, but the shipping cost more than the product itself."
"on November 14, 2017","The bottom stays on, but the top part won’t."
"on December 17, 2016","hard shell case is kinda loose...also seems used, the color isn't smooth like there's discoloration."
"on February 20, 2017","The bottom part of the case keeps on coming off - I think it's too big. I just took it off because it wont stay on.Other than that, I'm happy with it."
"on November 22, 2017","The case looks solid but it is prone to get dirty with hand marks. Overall, satisfied though."
"on February 6, 2017","Like this product BUT it does seem a bit loose on my laptop. And at times, needs readjusting."
"on August 5, 2017",Not the nicest case out there but it's functional.
"on June 11, 2017",Love the color and it went on good. The Corning of the top case broke and I had to order another one :(
"on June 18, 2017",Color is more blue than it looks online but overall seems like a good case.
"on January 24, 2018","Except for the keyboard skin, it was a good purchase overall."
"on December 13, 2016",This quality was not that good but I made the best of it!! Thanks for the fast delivery
"on March 9, 2017",The top pops off easily
"on August 21, 2017",DOEs not fit a MacBook Pro. It's too big.
"on October 16, 2016",I had the case on my computer for about a week and it's already scratched. It's not too bad but I wish it was more durable.
"on May 29, 2017","The plastic hard case is great. The keyboard cover doesn't stay on my keyboard. Other than that, this is amazing"
"on August 28, 2017","I liked the product, but the bottom case arrived broken. Everything else was fine."
"on November 3, 2016","It hides the apple logo. Also, the key board protector is opaque so it doesn't show the lights in the datk."
"on January 8, 2017",It's pretty cute but doesn't snap on all the way to one side of my Macbook Air.
"on August 25, 2017",Item came cracked but fits the mac book nicely. Screen protector did not work.
"on February 25, 2017",I had it for 4 months and it is slowing falling apart. Its ok but not amazing.
"on September 7, 2017",Case to large I am returning it.
"on January 18, 2017",There are some damages on the case. I feel that my laptop won't be so secure.
"on September 20, 2017","You get what u pay for with this one.  Low price, low quality."
"on February 5, 2017",Nice! But color fades quickly. Corners of case turned yellow. Very upsetting
"on October 8, 2017",I ordered the wrong one
"on February 20, 2017",Its nice but the top left corner of the screen does not fit all the way on.
"on July 29, 2017","Hard to see logo, cheap material."
"on December 12, 2016",It looks great but it was broken when i received it from the bottom corner
"on December 23, 2017",The cover fits perfectly; our daughter was very pleased to receive it.
"on January 11, 2018",You can't see the apple sign once you put on the cover.
"on January 16, 2017",I like the case but don't care much for the silicone keyboard cover.
"on August 20, 2017","Love the keyboard cover, but the case broke within a week and won't fit back onto my laptop."
"on September 14, 2017","Good case, had some trouble getting it to latch on."
"on December 7, 2016",A little disappointed with the quality but you get what you pay for
"on August 15, 2017",My case started chipping and I only had it for about a month
"on January 6, 2018",The screen protector did not stick properly.
"on September 27, 2017","Scratches easily, pops off the lower part of the laptop."
"on July 21, 2017","The color is a little off, but fits well."
"on October 9, 2017",I have had this product for a month and it is broken
"on December 13, 2017","Case broke within a month, other than that it's nice"
"on March 29, 2017",It cracked a week after putting it on
"on April 11, 2017",It has already cracked which sucks!
"on January 29, 2018",The top cover didn’t fit properly
"on January 17, 2017",Shipping was on time. Case doesn't fit snugly.
"on July 26, 2017",Disappointed as the color is faded in spots.
"on September 2, 2016",I like my MacBook Air cover but the bottom of the cover keep sliding.
"on September 7, 2017",The keyboard cover was stained and had what looks like ink on it.
"on April 22, 2017","This case looks good on and I like the feel of it but it is not a great fit. The top part fits ok but the bottom sits loosely and comes off easily. I do like the keyboard skin tho. It sits nicely on the keyboard and you almost can't even tell that there is a skin on it. Typing on it does take a little getting used to but not long. I like the feel of this skin more than the sleekness of the actual keys so I didn't mind giving it some time. Bottom line is I went with another case that is a little bulkier but I feel like it protects better, however I am still using the keyboard skin."
"on January 20, 2018",Good but is not like the photo
"on July 30, 2017",Difficult to take off
"on December 23, 2017",Arrived broken
"on January 2, 2017",Cover continues to fall off
"on January 5, 2017",doesn't stay on very well.
"on July 25, 2016","good quality for the price, but much bulkier than expected and added weight to my MacBook Air"
"on April 3, 2017",The screen protector is not in my package. I thought it is already included.
"on April 7, 2017",A little hard to take off once put on
"on April 30, 2017",Not strong at all to protect a las topWeek protection
"on October 5, 2016",The screen protector has a lot of bubbles
"on April 17, 2017",My daughter loves the color!
"on February 5, 2017",Case is okay and simple.
"on November 21, 2016",I get the size is different​
"on November 23, 2016",I ordered this case because I was getting sick of the case I had on my laptop for about a year now. I can tell the difference with my original case and this one. This case isn't so thick and doesn't fully cover my laptop like my old ones I'll still put it on my laptop but I definitely like the brand of my previous case better.
"on August 23, 2016","The keyboard cover does not match the hardshell case. Usually this wouldn't bother me, however it is very noticeably a different shade of pink. The case is a bright, light pink whereas the cover is a dusty rose. Other than the cover not matching the case, this is actually a pretty nice set. The screen protector was a great bonus and went on very easily. Over all, aside from the multiple shade of pink, this set is totally fine and will serve its purpose."
"on September 12, 2016","EDIT: This thing really smells on first opening, and uses a LOT of packaging. I thought it would be soft to the touch... that's a no go (Hard and shiny), but I don't want to leave my new computer unprotected.  I like the keyboard cover though.  I do wish it was white/clear."
"on August 21, 2016","I thought it was great, I did expect when it said to be soft for it to be like a rubber but regardless it's good and I really like it a lot and I was happy it wasn't just the case it was also other things 😌"
"on December 9, 2016",This was purchased as a Christmas gift so there is no review at this time. Thanks
"on December 25, 2017","After purchasing my MacBook Air I wanted to make sure I had something to keep it in great condition for as long as I have it. This case does just that. It’s very light weight and snaps on easily to keep your computer from getting any scratches. It stays on too, I've had it for almost a year now with no issues. While it does a great job of those things it comes with it’s own set of problems:1. The case gets very dirty and is difficult/impossible to clean. I have gotten lots of makeup smudges on it from touching my face and then touching the case and have had no luck removing it.2. I travel out of state on business an average of once a month and TSA is very confused by it. Every time I’m going through security I have to explain that I have removed it from it’s sleeve but it has this cell phone like case on it to keep it from getting scratched. Thankfully I have not yet had to take the case off, because that would not be an easy task. Especially with a hundred people behind me.Bottom line is an unenthusiastic yes I would buy it again. It’s important to me to keep my expensive computer in good condition and there aren’t a lot of different products to choose from in styles I like."
"on June 1, 2017","I agree with the reviews written by a few in that it arrived and looked great.  It was easy to put on (though I did not use the screen protector because it wouldn't place well).  Unfortunately, after less than 6 months of use, I'm already having portions crack off.  I am not rough on my computer, so there is no reason that the case should be breaking off at this point.  As such, my recommendation has to be with caveats.  It is inexpensive and it does the job well.  It also looks good.  But, I would have hoped for a longer lifespan - if it had made a full year and given the price, I would have given it a better review.  But, even at this price point, I would expect longer than 5 months."
"on November 20, 2017","The color is nice and I like that it comes with the keyboard cover (I didn't use the screen protector). However, you get what you pay for. I've had it for less than a year and it has several cracks. There is no lip that clicks on along the front, as I've had with previous laptop cases, and so the pressure of my wrists has pushed down on that part and caused cracking on the bottom front corners. Recently, a piece on the bottom right corner chipped off. Somehow, three of the four lips which hold the top part of the cover to the laptop have come off. It still manages to stay in place most of the time, but it does occasionally drop off if I accidentally knock it. I'll probably have to buy another case at some point, when this one chips off so much that it won't stay on anymore, but my friends with more expensive cases have also experienced chipping and cracking. Thus, I am more inclined to just buy cheaper cases like this instead of wasting my money on something more expensive that will fall apart anyway."
"on June 3, 2017","The case was exactly the color I wanted, but it arrived dirty with gray smudges splotched all over it, which was disappointing since I was really looking forward to such an attractive case. In addition to the smudges and weird gray spots that I can't seem to scrub out, the product arrived without the keyboard cover and screen protector like advertised. All in all, I don't think the product is poor, just that the state with which it reached my door was less than what I paid for, especially since the advertised keyboard cover and screen protector did not make it into the package. I'm disappointed that I will have to call and figure out where the missing pieces went because I was so confident that this was an incredible product before purchasing. Hopefully their customer service is great, only time will tell!"
"on August 19, 2017","I had purchased this case for the new school year and it is okay. The color is not what I expected, I purchased Serenity blue and it is MUCH more purple than the picture shows. I personally think it is more of a lavender color, I expected a slight hue of purple but not as much as I received. It is still a pretty color just super purple and I was hoping for more of a blue shade/tint to the case. Overall the case was easy to install and snapped right into place, but the case does not cover the entire corners of the bottom part of the computer. Lastly, the keyboard case is okay, it has a few bends in it but I am sure they will flatten out over time. My biggest complaint is that the keyboard case and laptop case do not 100% match in color, the keyboard case is much more blue, more like the color I expected of the case."
"on July 10, 2017","The cover was great for the first couple of weeks. I bought this cover in April 2017 and it is now July 2017. However, the ""hooks"" that hold the bottom cover to the laptop eventually broke. I noticed how the ""hooks"" were gradually chipping piece by piece. Now the bottom piece is loose. The ""hooks"" that broke of were the ones on the right and left side of the laptop. Even though the bottom cover does not work properly anymore, the top cover works great. It hangs on tight, which I'm not sure if it is a good or bad thing. I tried taking it off so I can clean my laptop, but it was difficult. The bottom cover came out fine, but the top cover takes effort.Overall, this laptop cover is okay. It looks nice and I did enjoy receiving a keyboard cover and screen protector with my purchase. I would advise to keep watch on the bottom cover ""hooks"" to make sure the same thing that happened for me does not happen to you."
"on November 1, 2017","I have had this case set for a little over two months now. It is holding up relatively well, but there are a few problems. First of all, you can see every single fingerprint on the case due to the texture. Doesn't bother me much, but it is definitely noticeable. The little plastic pieces that hold the case on have started to break off, and I never take it off my laptop. I feel like you are always better off having some form of protection on your device, but this product isn't perfect."
"on May 15, 2017","Only issue with the quality of the case is the bottom case at the corners does not run flush with the book and the plastic is thinner than I've had of another brand. I am concerned how long it will last with the abuse it's going to endure. I LOVE how this case make my Mac Air look!Key board sticks well when placed over keys. The keyboard cover takes getting used to. The keys feel soft when you press them.Someone in retail can relate or if you ever used the keyboards in school  with the plastic keyboard cover; you have to bang the keys to feel like you are pressing a key. I have gone without this feature. I don't see it really protecting my keyboard either.The screen protector is like any other. It's going to save from dust, scratched, etc. Like any seen protector, you have to put it on without bubbles, mine didn't but I don't knock it down for that because that's a user issue.Over all good product, if you are looking for a combo buy and haven't bought another brand to compare too. And it came with extra case bumpers plus a 1 year product warranty."
"on December 1, 2017","It arrived quickly! I love that it comes with a screen protector and keyboard cover. It also comes with extra little sticker buttons to keep the case from sliding on a desk but they kept falling off (maybe I’m too rough with my laptop). The reason why I’m giving this 3 stars is because my laptop fell with the case on and where one of the little plastic notches is the laptop was especially damaged. I don’t know for sure that the case is what caused the massive dent but it definitely didn’t protect it from the fall. Otherwise, if you aren’t clumsy like me, it’s a perfect vanity case. It’s really great for what I paid for it (I would still buy it again.)"
"on November 28, 2017","I love this case so much, I get so many complements on it. The pink is the same color as the picture which I really love. The keyboard cover is great as well, I've been using it for a few months and sometimes it bubbles up but very rarely. I have 3 stars because this case is nearly impossible to remove and when I needed to remove it, the bottom portion actually broke. Overall, it's a great case, just don't try to take it off!"
"on August 15, 2017","Love the color and everything, but I had no idea how delicate this thing would be. During the school year, I tug it around and whip it out and it's fine.When I'm at home it's usually on my floor just chillin'...One day I picked it up because I began my summer class, and in two...TWO spots it was breaking!!! I sat in befuddlement. I read so many good reviews about this, and I'm utterly disappointed. Seriously. Spend your money somewhere else. Don't listen to these reviews-- you get what you pay for. Cheap. Plastic. Protectors."
"on June 27, 2017",This case was really good... for about a few months. I really liked that it came with the keyboard protector and a screen protector! But after a few months of having the case on I have only taken it off maybe twice and have never dropped it but the parts that actually clip it to the computer started cracking. Now a couple months after it started cracking the parts that hold the case on have either completely broken off or have cracks and the case fall off now. I really liked the case and the color but I just wish it wouldn't crack.
"on March 23, 2017","I got this case to match my patterned MacBook sleeve bag. When I first got the case it was really nice. Unfortunately, not a day went by and the matte case became dirty. It was my fault I had just eaten French fries and my greasy fingerprints got on it. The problem however was that I cannot remove it. I tried everything from a wet paper towel to disinfectant wipes.The keyboard cover was also bad. I type slower on it because of the texture of the case. The cover also doesn't let the backlight of the keyboard shine through the letters, which is really inconvenient when you have to type in a darker setting or just want to type on because it looks pretty."
"on October 9, 2017",The keyboard cover that came with my package was cheap and doesn’t stay on the key board hardly at all. The plastic case is ok. It doesn’t snap on the one corner of the computer. Definitely not worth $14
"on April 12, 2017","I got the serenity blue color, it's a calm color and looks good. The screen protector leaves no bubbles, the keyboard cover doesn't move around I think I'm just not used to typing with it on. The outside cover is good it covers the apple though. It's nice but I don't know why I feel like it blocked the sound a little bit like my music doesn't sound all clear as it used to be."
"on October 5, 2016","Its a pretty case. The color is difficult to match but the keyboard cover gets as close as it can. However, the letters/ labeling on the keyboard cover don't adequately match up with the actual computer. They don't align. The apple, is kind of blurry and it isn't as easy as other cases to see. Its week one and the rubber feet on the bottom have worn out the rose gold color. I mean, for $13 it was worth it. Its cheap enough to buy more if I have to in the future. And this case I would say is original.... for now that is. But it isn't one that many people have already like the marble one or the basic colors. The screen protector is pretty good as well. Im satisfied, next time I would like to try the marroon one."
"on July 24, 2017","I like it , it protects the computer a lot.Only bad thing about it is the keyboard cover which was more of the reason I bought it. If you have the keyboard light on the letters will look double because the keyboard cover is not printed exactly the same. So at night, I can't really see the letters clearly and in the day I have to make sure the keyboard light is off ."
"on November 24, 2017","I really like the texture of everything, and the color is amazing. The reason why it’s 3 star is because I received the screen protector with a bent corner and the quality isn’t that good.. (which was expected) but overall pretty happy with the rest of the items."
"on May 20, 2017","I ordered the Rose Quartz color, and will be exchanging for a different color. I know colors can look a bit different online, however, I was certainly not expecting what was labeled on what I received: ""Rose Quartz-- baby pink"". I wouldn't have bought it if it said the 'baby pink' part, and looking at it now, I can understand that yes, it is a bit baby pink. Basically, decent product, looks nice, shipped nice, arrived on time, but the product description online did not match what I got or what I wanted, so I'll be switching it out."
"on October 8, 2017","it's a good case and all - for the first month. After a while the top case starts detaching from the computer all the time and there are even some cracks on mine when I haven't dropped it once. Kinda disappointing, mainly cause I already decorated it with my stickers."
"on October 21, 2017","I loved the color and the feel, it's just the top cover keeps shifting towards a side and popping off! The last time I tried to put it back on it cracked! It has only been 3 weeks. I need a replacement. Luckily Mosio has a year warranty. I just need to know how to contact them!"
"on March 27, 2017","Beautiful color (peacock green). The downfall is that it's a bit flimsy, and as others have said, seems ""cheaply made"". The corners don't fit as well as I would have liked. The keyboard cover fits really well, which I guess is the highlight of my purchase. It also came with a screen protector, which would be a plus if it fit perfectly from corner to corner."
"on June 30, 2017",Pretty color case but definitely not rose gold it's more like shimmer purple. It does not match my iPhone rose gold the keyboard skin is more a like. I bought with a mosiso bag in blushing pink I was hoping all together to be a great match in color but unfortunately it didn't. Maybe with the rose quartz the bag will match.
"on September 6, 2017","Feels great, seems easy to clean, good fit. Color pink quartz more like baby pink, goes perfect w same brand chevron sleeve. Returned bc got one w scratch n hated the keyboard cover bc it was bubbly and drove me crazy. Will be buuing the camel color, hope this time get better keybd cover."
"on December 13, 2017",It is OK for HARD plastic. Scratches easily. Price could have been a little lower for better rating
"on June 30, 2017",I'm not one to complain but when I opened it the bottom of the case (the top corner was broke) see picture if confused. I love the case itself it's just it came broke which might have been due to the fact of the shipping.. I would like my bottom replaced
"on December 5, 2016",
"on April 10, 2017","I bought the frost case and serenity blue case.There were no directions included, but a tip on how to easily put on and take off the case would have been nice...CASE: It came with some scratches, which made it look like I've had it for a while, even though it's brand new. When I run my hands over the top, I can feel a lot tiny bumps, but these cannot be seen to the naked eye. There were small rectangles that indicated were the clips were, so the look was not smooth. The clips did not fit securely and looks like it puts stress on the case as it tries to grab on. The apple logo can be seen when the laptop is both on and off for the frost, but can only be seen when on for the serenity blue.KEYBOARD PROTECTOR: Fits keyboard well. The frost cover did not have any design and was just a dull plastic. It was thin, but stiff, and typing felt like poking bubble wrap. The serenity blue cover had the color and key letters printed on it. It was also thin, but not as stiff, which made it easier to type.SCREEN PROTECTOR: The little cleaning film the company provided was cheap and barely did anything to remove smudges and dust particles. I"
"on December 20, 2017",I love the look it gives . But don’t eat around it because it will leave a stand .
"on June 11, 2017",Everything is going but the screen protector it not quite good and durable it easy to scratch
"on June 24, 2017","I got the pastel pink color and it shipped fast and arrived nicely with no damage. The keyboard cover is nice but occasionally lifts up. It also takes a little while to get used to typing with it. The bottom part of the case fits nicely and hasn't lifted yet. My only big concern is the top cover. First of all, it doesn't come with the Apple logo as it appears in the picture. When the computer is off, the Apple logo doesn't show at all and it's just smooth pink. When the computer is on, the Apple logo glows through the case and looks blurry and not smooth and clear like how the picture shows. Second, the most important thing is that the top cover doesn't snap on fully. I am able to get the top three ""hooks"" to snap on as well as ONE bottom hook, but the other bottom one just doesn't stay on. This causes the top cover to not stay on and pop off occasionally. This is a pretty good product for preventing scratches and dirt, but I would probably not buy again."
"on July 15, 2017",The case was very good but the keyboard cover i got rid not match the real keys. I am very upset about this.
"on May 22, 2017","Overall, the actual case is nice. It's sturdy, easy to clip on and the color is really pretty. However, I am incredibly disappointed with the screen protector and keyboard cover. The keyboard cover came dirty and discolored, and is awkward making it difficult to type. The screen protector was the biggest disappointment though. It came already covered in tiny specks of fuzz and dirt making it pretty much impossible for me to get out all the air bubbles. Then being the perfectionist that I am, I struggled with it for at least 45 minutes trying to remove the air bubbles with no success. Eventually, I just gave up and put it where it really belonged - in the trash.Another annoying part to this order was that I also ordered this case in the serenity blue color and that didn't even come with the keyboard cover or the screen protector.The only reason this is getting 3 stars is because the colors of both cases are very pretty, there is an extra set of feet and I really like that there is a year warranty on the case. However, ev"
"on January 17, 2017",Bought this for my daughter's MacBook works well. Very pretty color🙂
"on February 4, 2017",The screen cover is difficult to place on the computer without leaving bubbles. It would have been good if they would have included instructions on how to apply. It is also difficult to remove once it is on the computer. Instructions for this would be handy as well.
"on September 12, 2017",love the color.  the bottom and keyboard part fits perfectly but the top shell part is lose and comes off sometimes.
"on November 23, 2017",Pretty good but its kind of a weird fit. Case is good material. Both case and keyboard pad are not the best fit but overall it was decent. Maybe if you were looking for something great then look for better quality set. :)
"on October 16, 2017","I like how the case fits perfectly on my MacBook Air, but once I put everything on I began to smell this weird odor on the case and keyboard cover. Taking out the case was also difficult to manage. Other than that, the color is very nice."
"on June 11, 2017",It starts to break down after half a year.
"on May 23, 2017","Cracked in numerous places and doesn't fit my laptop anymore, but my laptop works fine. Stickers on bottom lost color after like a week. Will not repurchase."
"on April 11, 2017","Looks good so far... pretty pink, nice feel, etc. I would have rated 5 but I did not receive the keyboard protection"
"on December 12, 2017","I loved this case for the first couple months. However, by the end of the semester, there were several places that had cracked or broken."
"on December 28, 2016","Cover did not fit our Macbook Air, too small :( Color was okay, very light, not as ""rose gold-y"" as we thought it would be."
"on December 20, 2017",This is a Christmas gift so I have yet to determine if the item has any issues.
"on January 21, 2017",I'm just annoyed that one of the side snapped and also it doesn't always stay on from the bottom sides
"on October 27, 2017",I did not use the skin for the keyboard. It was quite flimsy and didn't perfectly cover the keys.
"on September 19, 2017",The case doesn't snap in. the top part falls off sometimes. Very annoying.
"on September 13, 2017",looks great but bottom slips off sometimes.
"on September 9, 2017",quality is midium
