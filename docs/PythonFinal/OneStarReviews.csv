"on December 21, 2017",This thing is total junk.  Don't buy it... the paint quality is terrible... the plastic is super thin... and the protective film for the screen is low quality and caused all kinds of bubbles that wouldn't go away.  I would not recommend this product.  I was so upset with this I threw it in the trash and went and bought a Speck.
"on December 31, 2017","This plastic thing fits together, but you can’t open the display all the way up.  Yes, it fits, but it is uncomfortable to use because the front lip is much higher than the computer itself and scratchs my wrists while typing.  It looks okay, but the design is crap.  The keyboard cover works okay.  Forget about the display film.  That was impossible to put on without bubbles forming under and I used to install large vinyl signs, so forget about it.  The screen film is also not cut correctly to actually fit the monitor properly.  This is another crap product on the king of crap products...  Amazon"
"on January 26, 2018","I'm really frustrated with the quality of this case. I recently purchased my very own MacBook from money that I made at an after school job, and i was so excited to get all the accessories that come with it, and I ordered this case against my better judgement because everyone else seemed to like it in the reviews -- big mistake. Granted, I only paid about $13 for the case, but I still expected that the case would stay on my MacBook Air for more than a day. After snapping my MacBook into the case and zipping it into a sleeve, I took it to school so that I would be able to work on my laptop throughout the day. When I got to my first period, I opened my bag and one of the hinges that attaches the case to my MacBook had already come off! I was very gentle with the MacBook and even took the care to zip it into a protective sleeve and still, the case lasted less than a day. Perhaps I got a faulty case, but I am overall very upset with the case and the company."
"on January 23, 2018","I was looking forward to this. It fits well and looks great. The keyboard cover is also good. However, to my dismay, it is starting to crack off from a side. After reading all the positive reviews, I am thinking this is a freak accident...but definitely a bummer. I will be returning it soon. It’s too bad because I love the color and the feel of the product :("
"on February 26, 2017","I purchased two cases at the same time. This Mosiso case in rose, and an iDOO case in a marble textured color. These were both for my MacBook air purchased in 2017. The iDOO case fits perfectly and is beyond what I expected, but this rose colored case was more expensive, does not fit properly as advertised, has no option for returns, and the seller will not answer me on how I can return their faulty product for my money back."
"on October 4, 2017","I'm kind of disappointed in the case, after reading so many good reviews I purchased. I've only had it for 2 months this and it has already Brock and cracked, not sure if mine was just defective or not. Where the two pieces meet when you shut your laptop mine would hit and one side broke off, it has cracked in three places. I'm not rough at all with my laptop because I'm afraid I'd break the air. Hopefully mine was just a bad one."
"on February 2, 2018","Bought this as a temperary case until I could find a nice one. I've had it around a week and at first I liked the look and how it felt. The plastic screen protector seems fine, as does the keyboard cover. My issue is the bottom half of the case doesn't stay on correctly, it has clips on three sides, but the back doesn't have any. The back corners are always pulling off therefore letting the case slide off. It literally does not stay on and my computer doesn't sit right because of it. Terribly cheap case but I guess you get what you pay for. 10/10 would never buy again."
"on September 17, 2017",This case is NOT what they advertise. The case does not fit onto a MacBook and has no lip to hold onto a laptop. It is just a flat piece of plastic that falls right off of the laptop when you attempt to put it on. I have never been so disappointed in a laptop case and I can't believe they actually sell this to people. It is impossible to put on a laptop and I am very disappointed. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Waste of money.
"on February 25, 2017","The color is more pink then ""rose gold"" doesn't match my phone in rose gold. I put it on my laptop and was a little concerned that it didn't click on. Didn't really seem like a good fit. I picked it up to move it and when I set it down (very gently, how I usually handle my laptop) and it cracked about a 2-inch piece off from itself. The bottom pads are very cheap too. They were falling off and getting so dirty right away. It was more like a foam than a piece of rubber. I requested an exchange for a different color and hoping it was just that one that would crack and was told to take pictures and send. I got very busy at work and a couple weeks later I tried to upload my pictures to get my exchange and the seller closed out my return. It would have been nice to get an email or something or notice saying you only have a certain amount of time to process the exchange. Won't be buying from this seller again."
"on January 1, 2018","Only after weeks the surface for the case was all scratches up and it had spots where the paint had been erased. It looks old and used up only after weeks of use. Even with a protective pack the case got all scratched up. The screen protector never went on the laptop because it was very very hard to place. The apple logo is very hard to see through the case (just thought i should mentions it but it isn't a problem for me) On the other hand, the case fits very well and its been protecting the actual laptop. Overall, Completely unsatisfied and hate this product."
"on March 20, 2017",the silver one doesn't fit A1466 at all. it's small. but the keyboard worked well. but had to return it... also you can not see the lighted apple logo through the case
"on December 31, 2017","Definitely not gold (more pink in it) and it scratched right away when something rubbed against it. The color came off already after having it on the computer for less than 30 minutes. Very disappointed in this specific color. I have the light pink and love it, but this is just a painted on “gold” that rubs off. Really disappointed."
"on August 29, 2017","I'd give it zero stars if I could! The bottom right left corner completely cracked and came off after 1 week!! I didn't bang it, ding it, nothing! I pulled it out of my laptop bag and set it on my desk and it came off. Waste of money."
"on September 26, 2017",I ordered the Rose Red cover for my laptop. In the picture it looks hot pink. It's bright and beautiful. I received the package today and the plastic cover looks like a pink purple. It's nothing close to what the item looks like in the picture. I didn't even take it out the plastic bag! Same day I received it is the same day I shipped it back!
"on November 30, 2016","The top cover of this Mosio Plastic Hard Case that I received would not snap onto the top of my MacBook.  I sent it back and ordered the iBenzer Basic Soft-Touch Series Plastic Hard Case, which worked great, and I even ordered 2 more of the iBenzer Basic Soft-Touch Series Plastic Hard Case for 2 other people."
"on January 30, 2018","As soon as a unboxed my case (Rose Gold), I noticed it was damaged right away. One of the footpads is messed up, and there are a few areas where the paint has been scratched off. The keyboard cover has a strange smell of sour apples and doesn't match up with the laptop keys. The case comes of easily and the screen protector doesn't cover all of the screen."
"on August 2, 2017","Awful! The product received was a baby pink instead of the color shown. Worse yet, it was broken in one corner. Don't waste your time and, definitely, not your money ordering this cheap case."
"on August 12, 2017","We could not get this cover installed.  We thought the cover or the MacBook were going to break trying, so we gave up and ordered a different cover.  We returned this one."
"on October 10, 2017",This case was cheap so I'm not too upset. You get what you pay for. The case arrived missing 2 clips or shall I say the clips were already broken. The screen protector is super cheap as well. If they send me another case than maybe ill change my mind but as of now I don't recommend this unless you're cheap and want a quick fix but since Mac books are 1k just shell out and get something nice like I am soon.
"on February 15, 2017","This case broke as soon as I put it on. I got one that wouldn't even snap on due to the top snap not being made correctly. So I sent it back, got a new one, and then the top snap snapped off within the week. I have had this case now for 3 months and it has broken in multiple cases and I am not hard on it, it just randomly broke. The base doesn't stick and slides off, which causes sometimes a cracking noise when I open my laptop."
"on February 10, 2017","The color was beautiful and the texture of the keypad cover is amazing and so much better than the normal feel of the MacBook keyboard. My huge point deduction comes from the fact that the covers didn't fit properly. No matter how I tried to snap the top cover into place it would not fit and the snaps broke. I ordered the proper case and even watched a YouTube video on how to install it but the ""prongs"" weren't sized properly, so I paid for this and only get to use the screen protector and keyboard cover"
"on March 1, 2017",I have had this item for only a little while and it does NOT go through anything hard but the whole this cracked and it breaking apart already. It started to break apart after the first week
"on January 30, 2018",Came with something stuck inside the cover which shows and is ugly. Good color product though
"on January 10, 2018",The “pink” case does not look anything like the one online. It is a see through pink case but online it looks like it is not see through. I’m very disappointed with this purchase.
"on January 3, 2017","Mosiso Plastic Hard Case with Keyboard Cover & Screen Protector for MacBook Air - 13 inchBottom cover worked well. Screen protector worked well. Keyboard cover worked well. Top cover was 1 mm too small and would not snap into place. After multiple tries by different people over a couple of days, tabs broke off and unit does not work. Will need to discard both covers and buy something else."
"on December 18, 2016",Front cover will not stay  on. Cracked tab to boot. It is going back this week.
"on June 3, 2017","Horrible case, lots of finger prints on the case and it it not very sturdy. Keeps coming off and I have to reclicking it on. Also, the 4 point pads on the bottom come off easily which is annoying."
"on March 13, 2017",Laptop case is already broken/cracked on some sides and edges. Horrible quality. I've had this product for at least 3 months & i barely use my computer and the case is already cracked.
"on December 1, 2016",Absolute trash. Not worth your money. So difficult to put on and remove and when I contacted the seller they told me to use a hair dryer. Also my item came with a crack. if I could give it less than a 1 star I would
"on October 18, 2017",sadly did not fit my MacBook perfectly. liked the color and feels though.
"on January 8, 2018","This product came in the wrong color, along with the other 2 for my team members (I was supposed to receive the neutral grey and the gold but they instead sent something close in each of these colors). And one of them came BROKEN.The product is a very cheap material and they include black marks on some of the cases. Would never purchase again!"
"on January 16, 2018",This was so cheaply made and has broken/and cracked.
"on January 16, 2018","Case was fine and it fit. However, my daughter didn't like the color so I wanted to send it back for a refund. She found another case she liked. I paid 13.99 for this case and it cost 8.45 to send back. That is ridiculous. We'll probably give it away. I won't order from this seller again based on the amount it cost to send back."
"on September 2, 2017","The Picture shows as a deep red, or burgundy. Actual product received was a sort of faded, off color, light dirty pink/rose. Nothing like the sales photograph. Returned."
"on January 23, 2018",The case is cracked in multiple locations and pieces have broken off just from opening and closing the case. All of the rubber stoppers on the bottom have fallen off. Complete waste of money.
"on November 28, 2017",Pretty color but the bottom portion of the case had pieces broken off.  Have not been able to find a way to contact seller to send me a replacement.
"on August 25, 2017","Case arrived with a crack and bottom doesn't fully snap on. I have the MacBook Air specified in the description so I thought there would be no fitting issues, but apparently I was wrong. Screen protector and keyboard cover were a nice addition, but ultimately doesn't make up for the overall poor quality of the case."
"on May 24, 2017","I would not recommend this product, came already with one corner broken and it feels like it's going to have an ugly dead in little time. Also one side of the top cover slips out easily."
"on December 13, 2017","The case breaks so easy, the little tabs that hold the case on the laptop broke within 3 weeks of having it the screen saver and the keyboard cover are good, keyboard cover is fading bc of the amount of times I use my laptop but that was as expected"
"on March 1, 2017",It cracked and broke within a month.
"on September 22, 2017",Arrived cracked and have no way to file a complaint or ask for an exchange. Willing to update the review if matter is resolved.
"on January 28, 2018","I have had this case for less than 6 months, and already the corner has broken off, has not been dropped or anything like that. Is there some sort of warranty on this item? Would like a replacement!  I would like an email from the company regarding this issue."
"on April 3, 2017","Had this case for a little over a month, never dropped my computer and for some reason the plastic piece holding the case onto the computer broke. It is also cracking on the sides."
"on February 2, 2017","Really bad, not worth the $$$$, feels like it'll break in a few weeks and look at this junk screen protector!!"
"on January 11, 2017","If only I could give no stars. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. Not only does it look way different than pictured, it does not even fit the laptop. I payed $13.99 for the case and they want to charge me $9 to send it back. This is absolutely ridiculous! I also ordered the matching sleeve and its way too big. I will never be ordering from this company again, and I hope you don't either."
"on October 24, 2017",I am very disappointed in the quality of this case. I just took it out of my backpack and I noticed the color of the case came off. It was less than 24 hours of use and the color came off. This was the worst case I've ever purchased.
"on July 14, 2017",Not what I expected. Plastic is not quality it appears online an moreover the top piece does not stay on the laptop and comes off every time I open. Finally got tired and took the whole thing off. Would like to return.
"on October 7, 2017",Edge of the case broke off right away.Very poor quality.
"on May 19, 2017","I was really looking forward to using this. However, I noticed that the gripper on the bottom part was broken. I'm unsure as to whether the product arrived damaged or not, but I only received it 2 hours ago. So, either way, I'm very disappointed."
"on September 17, 2016",Bottom/base unit yes not fit. Back protrudes and catches display when it opens. I have A1466 MacBook Air. It clearly says it is made for this model.Did I just get a defective unit?
"on October 16, 2017","How anyone could give this product anything beyond a 1 star is beyond imagination. Its a flimsy piece of plastic. This is going to protect my $1600 computer? Granted, it was cheap - my hopes were high and I've been set straight."
"on October 28, 2017",Loved the look of this case but after carrying in my backpack for a couple of months it started to crack. Never dropped it!
"on May 23, 2017",I'm really gentle with my macbook and this didn't last. It broke pieces off within weeks.
"on November 7, 2017",The cover doesn’t stay on .. I️ do like the key cover
"on February 9, 2017","Case did not fit MacBook Air A1466 after multiple attempts. In addition, the case came with a dirty keyboard that looked used."
"on October 24, 2017","The color was a lot brighter than shown in the picture. It is very ugly and fluorescent (I got the color Chartreuse). The case did not even fit correctly on my laptop. Once I managed to get it on, it damaged my laptop. Do not buy this case. Invest in a better quality case!!"
"on September 23, 2017",I have purchase 3 of these cases. The first came with a broken tab/clip and was returned. The second had 3 broken tabs within six weeks of use. The third came very scratched and wouldn't attach to the Macbook at all.
"on January 9, 2017",I didn't even have it for a week and then it broke out of nowhere. Returned it and got my money back and got a different case.
"on December 25, 2016","The top piece won't click on properly and pops off with the slightest touch. The color, texture, look, etc. are all very nice, but useless if it won't stay on."
"on December 7, 2016","Does not stay on my new MacBook Air--it just doesn't fit, constantly falls off. I'm very disappointed. The screen protector is fine...a bit difficult to apply without getting bubbles. The keyboard cover fits and is easy to clean."
"on April 20, 2017",Love the look of the case but it dampers my audio because the case covers the speakers. If I want to listen to any sound i have to take off the cover. Pretty annoying.
"on June 17, 2017","Very cheap quality, won't protect an MacBook at all! I started the process to return the item, it was too complicated so I just threw it out. Total waste of money, keep looking!"
"on October 21, 2016",Very cheap and flimsy product.The screen protector was a joke and the keyboard cover keeps on moving and makes it impossible to type.
"on January 14, 2018","When I first got the case it was fine, after 2 weeks or so the case started wearing out. About a month later the case has been completely worn out. The case doesn't fit anymore and its useless. I would say buy 2 at one time just in case."
"on February 9, 2018",Corners chipped within a couple weeks without dropping or mishandling the computer and the case already kept popping off before that.
"on January 26, 2018","Looks perfect the way is on the picture but when i open had a crack and i m not sure is my mc will be protected was waiting so much for them ,i got a blue one for my friend that is ok mine broken 😭😭😭"
"on December 2, 2017","The bottom snapped on fine, but the top never did. It continues to fall off and I gave up on it finally."
"on July 11, 2017",The second image shoes incorrectly that the Apple image show through the back of the screen. The keyboard protector does not stick correctly and feels loose when you're typing. Returning the product and will not buy again.
"on January 1, 2018","Loved the color and texture, but could not get the bottom half of the case to snap on (Macbook Air 13 inch, model A1466) at all points of contact, no matter how many ways I tried. Unfortunately, returning it for one that fits."
"on November 22, 2017",Did not fit the macbook pro 2015.Too big.
"on October 29, 2017",This laptop cover cracked in less than 1 month. It is supposed to be protective!! With regular use it cracked < 1 month after I purchased it.
"on January 3, 2018",The cover case came peel it off !It came with a defect. I want a change product! It is a shame as everything else is ok. But I think is not fair to received something with defect
"on November 4, 2016",This case does NOT fit a 13 in macbook air! Such a scam. Do NOT ever buy from this company.
"on August 23, 2017","I did not get a good experience with you guys, sorry to say. I didn't get the screen protector and the cases for the bottom and top were really dirty and all scratched up. I got the it for my son and he was really sad about it."
"on November 17, 2016","The actual case was broken when it arrived. However, I liked the screen and keyboard protector."
"on December 2, 2016",We could not get it to stay ok I would not buy it again or suggest anyone else to buy it.
"on April 27, 2017",This is very cheap flimsy plastic.  Will not protect a computer.
"on November 27, 2017","Does not properly fit the model of MacBook it describes. I have bought from this company before and it fit fine, not sure why the same exact one in a different color does not fit."
"on May 20, 2017",did not fit.
"on October 20, 2017","I was told I would receive a replacement for the portion that did not fit, it has been about two weeks and nothing. Terrible follow through on their word. The Silicon for the keyboard did fit well though."
"on January 23, 2017","IF the product fit properly, this would have been a five star review. Unfortunately, the cover did not fit my 13 inch macbook air. The color and everything else was great. SOOOOOOO disappointed that it didn't work out."
"on July 28, 2017","This sucked. Don't buy it, it doesn't come with the keyboard cover or the screen protector and the case is really low quality. High price for only being a case with none of the other advertised items."
"on May 27, 2017","I was extraordinarily disappointed with how quickly this case began to crack and pieces started falling off. While I've taped it back together, even the slightest bump results in a crack or a small fragment falling off."
"on January 11, 2017",I wish I took a picture before I threw it out. SO MANY SCRATCHES. I kept my laptop in my backpack for a week and it looked like the case was dirty. Turns out it was being easily scratched with black underneath... DO NOT buy.
"on April 20, 2017",The keyboard cover fit okay but got stuck between keys. The top and bottom case cracked on the first day and the prongs holding them on broke off within the first week. Got a replacement and it broke again two weeks later. Only good if you never bring your laptop anywhere.
"on February 4, 2017","Super flimsy and already broken,really loved the color but as soon as i clipped it on to actually secure I found it broken. The clips that should be holding on to the laptop itself are broken off as well."
"on April 26, 2017",this cracked the 1st day.
"on April 18, 2017",Finally had to throw it away because it would not stay on the computer. I was asked for pictures but files could not be sent to email provided. Not worth the time or energy. Very disappointed.
"on August 27, 2017",Tabs to hold the top layer on broke within a month
"on March 4, 2017",I have been trying for weeks to switch my case and I can't get the mosiso case on. The clips that hold the case on are too small and create difficulty for getting the case on.
"on November 29, 2017",This is the second case that I have ordered and both have cracked!! I take good care of my computer and this should not be happening within 3 months of having this case.
"on August 16, 2017",Not as it says in the web description and came with multiple scratches and the screen protector was way smaller than my actual screen. Don't buy this!!!
"on January 5, 2018",The cover started cracking and bits of it broke off around the edges within 2 months. I take very good care of my laptop and it is in a teacher bag all the time. Very disappointed.
"on October 5, 2017",Thought the apple icon would be better to see. Soft plastic like it says. Expect cheaper quality. The products come a bit scuffed and dirty even though it's new? My screen protector came dirty.
"on February 6, 2018","The bottom corner that holds the case on broke after only having it for two weeks. I didn't throw it around to cause it to break either, it broke from setting it down on a table."
"on December 20, 2017","The bottom of the case fit, however the top is too small. I believe the top piece belongs to the 11 inch."
"on March 14, 2017",this started cracking after 3 weeks. I opened my laptop and a piece came off. terrible quality.
"on January 20, 2017","I would rate this 5 stars but I only received the case cover without the screen protector or keyboard cover, very disappointed. I was looking forward to this product bc of the other reviews."
"on January 31, 2017",Not good quality and it didn't fit correctly. Even though it was snapped into place it kept falling off. The material also makes fingerprints very visible. I ended up buying another case instead.
"on August 6, 2017",It came damaged. The bottom part fit but the top part was clearly missing a tab so it wouldn't fit. Overall I'm disappointed but not surprised based off the cost. You get what you pay for.
"on April 7, 2017",Looked great for about a month then pieces started cracking off. The whole right side has now cracked off and it won't even clip onto my computer anymore. Very disappointed!
"on July 30, 2017",I've never had a problem with my items from Amazon and I've boughten plenty but this case did not fit right at all and I was very disappointed.
"on December 26, 2016",Besides t was missing the keyboard cover it looks very poor and cheap quality worst part it fits weird and it comes off so easy doesn't stay in. I bought for a gift for Xmas and now I have to look for something else and I feel horrible cause they don't have a gift in time.
"on October 3, 2017","Mine does not clip onto the top of my Macbook Air properly, so it falls off most of the time. Wanted to return but apparently missed the return window. : ("
"on January 16, 2018",I receive my case broken from a corner and it was a gift sent to Guatemala.
"on February 15, 2018","In less than 2 months of use the cover got stains that can't be removed, terrible quality.After just a week of use the bottom pieces for support fell, don't recommend it at all."
"on March 4, 2017","First case was too tight for laptop, secondly quality of product is cheap. Bottom piece broke while trying to fit it on. Very disappointed with this purchase.I gave one star because seller contacted me to check on my experience."
"on January 30, 2018",Product bottom cracked before I could utilize it
"on July 1, 2017",Does not fit at all. Had a hard time trying to put it on and it broke (my mac is the exact same model)  So bad I don't even wanna change the item. Just threw it away.
"on March 16, 2017","after a week, the top shell's edge began crumbling off, and the side ""clips"" on the bottom part of the shell that attach it to the laptop broke off. I am very disappointed with the poor quality of this cover. I wish I can give it 0 stars"
"on August 9, 2017",bottom part does not fit. it doesnt clip on and i didnt receive a screen protector either.
"on February 10, 2018",Case did not stay on my laptop. Kept falling off. Very disappointed in this purchase. I ended up just taking the whole thing off because it was so ineffective.
"on January 12, 2018",The case doesn’t even properly fit my comuter . The screen protector collects dust very easily and the keyboard cover doesn’t stay on.
"on October 29, 2017",Does not fit MacBook Air! I tried to return it and there was no label and now I am not allowed to return it at all even though I can't use it.
"on November 20, 2017","The paint had begun to wear off of the keyboard cover by the second week. By the third week, pieces of the case were breaking and falling off."
"on December 24, 2017","I wanted to get my wife a gold case to match the iPhone gold and Apple Watch, instead I got a copper case that matches the pipes under my sink. THE GOLD IS NOT REAL GOLD."
"on March 10, 2017","The top cover does not stay on. It comes off every time I open my laptop. The hard case does not have very much grip, the clips are to slim."
"on April 28, 2017",broke in 2 months. Not worth at all.
"on October 8, 2017",Corners of case break almost immediately. The keyboard cover is way too big for the macbook air. Very poor quality. Would not recommend.
"on January 25, 2017","Do not buy this , broke within days and wouldn't even stay on my laptop when I held it . Yes it was the right size . Cheap quality but the keyboard cover isn't bad 😕"
"on July 23, 2017","It didnt go well at all the case dose not clip, front or back. Disassembled in senconds i want my money back or a product that works. Im sorry but its just no bueno!"
"on May 17, 2017","the case is hard to put on and once I finally did, it cracked. After month of use, the top case falls off every time I open my laptop. Waste of money."
"on August 25, 2017",I have received the hard case a little broken
"on April 5, 2017","The description says it's for a 13"" MacBook Air. When we put the case on it was to big by almost 1"" on all sides."
"on July 26, 2017",I buy Three oficina diferent color and the 3 has a diferent size in all the pizes. And the keyboar cover vas pretty laim the material Is not the best
"on March 22, 2017","It was dirty and scratched on the inside of the case, so no matter how many times I wipe it or try to clean it it always looks dirty. Pretty disappointed"
"on July 11, 2017",The top piece doesn't fit.  Everything else did but the top part won't snap on.
"on December 12, 2017","It has a sharp end on the edge where you place your hands to write. Plus it's a very low-quality product, It broke within the first 2 months of use."
"on January 23, 2017",Item showed up and the edge was broken off. The case does not look as pictured and looks very cheap in terms of quality. Would not order from this company again.
"on December 6, 2017","very poor quality,"
"on October 3, 2017",Top case didn't fit right and constantly falls off. Plastic part that sticks out broke after a month. Really bought it for the color but super disappointed in the quality.
"on February 11, 2018",the bottom casing fit but there was room on the top so it didn't fit snug and the left side covered the mic port
"on December 8, 2016",It was broken when I opened the box.
"on November 30, 2017",did not fit
"on July 12, 2017","Although the right model number for the case, it does not fit well. Also caused some scratches on.my computer."
"on October 7, 2017",I ordered a Gold Case for my macbook air and i recieved a rose gold one and the keyboard cover is way to loose for the macbook air!! Dont buy
"on September 22, 2017",Started cracking and falling apart after one month of light use. Very disappointing. I'll spend more in the future in hopes of higher quality.
"on May 16, 2017",Didn't fit my computer and the clips were broken even before I tried putting it on
"on May 31, 2017",Very very hard to get on. The case is hard plastic and cracked in two weeks. Waste of money.
"on June 15, 2017",Every time I open my MacBook Air the top comes off. It went in the trash. A waste of money.
"on October 26, 2017",If I could give zero stars I would. This case is just poorly made - the bottom cover doesn’t even fit. Disappointed!
"on May 22, 2017",I did not receive the keyboard cover or screen protector with purchase. Very disappointed because I liked the cover but the additional accessories were not shipped with it. Not worth the money.
"on February 23, 2017","The top cover piece pops off any chance it gets.... Seeing as that is the main point of having this product, I hate it. Color is nice though"
"on January 18, 2018",Arrived with a small chip and corners continued to chip soon after. Thoroughly unimpressed with the quality and the durability of the case.
"on February 12, 2018",It’s a cute case but it came broken where the bottoms snaps onto the MacBook so I can’t use the bottom part.
"on January 23, 2018",It didn’t come with the screen protector like it lead me to believe AND the top of the case falls off every time I pick it up or open it
"on October 1, 2017","The quality is great but the jet black color looks horrible in person, They also send me a used case when I bought a new one"
"on January 27, 2017","The case was nice, keyboard layover was a little stiff. My case also broke as soon as I tried to remove it. It just clips on to tight"
"on October 19, 2017","The color did not match the description.  Also the case for the bottom is an actual color too. In the picture, it looks see through."
"on November 1, 2016",I have a Macbook air 13 in from 2015 and the bottom did not fit right. I was expecting the case to hard shell rubberized but it wasn't it was all plastic and a bit shiny. It was OK..
"on February 15, 2017","I liked the color of it, but the top part did not fit. I even had them replace it and send a new one and it still did not fit."
"on August 14, 2017",Horrible! The bottom half of the case works fine but the top half was about an inch too small and didn't even fit my computer!
"on August 2, 2017",So disappointed. So upset.
"on July 26, 2017",Did not fit. I verified 3 times if I ordered the correct item for my computer. The clips on case do not align. Pick another brand. I returned.
"on January 29, 2018",this item did not work for my daughter. It was flimsy and kept falling off computer. I returned this item.
"on October 24, 2017","I loved the dark green color, but the top piece would not snap on. I ended up having to order another case from another company."
"on September 8, 2017",The chip on the bottom of came offf
"on January 22, 2018","please don't waste your money purchasing this. The minute I put it on, the corner of the case snapped."
"on January 27, 2017",Broke when I was trying to put it on the computer.
"on September 5, 2017",And it doesn't fit the MacBook at all. It's too big It as pink as it looks in the picture. Just has a slight pink tint :(
"on October 6, 2017",Won't snap on to the computer which kind of defeats the purpose of having it as a case
"on February 13, 2017",Bottom half fits perfectly and the keyboard cover is cute but the top half would not clip on to my computer. :(
"on January 24, 2017",More bits chip off every day. My wrists have gotten scratched up. Worse than nothing. Have had for 1.5 months.
"on October 19, 2017",It broke after the first use. Such a waste of money.
"on October 5, 2017",The package did not include the screen protector and the keyboard cover. The case barely stays on my laptop.
"on November 22, 2017",the first one I bought would not snap on my lap top. Amazon sent me a second one and this one will not stay on!
"on April 27, 2017","Poor quality, I will be returning. Also, did not come with keyboard protection."
"on October 20, 2017",Cheap product. You got what you paid.
"on September 17, 2016",I would give zero star for this product! Arrived after a day of ordering but arrived with scratches on and damages screenprotector! Disappointed!
"on November 7, 2017","Horrible Case. Do not buy, it doesn't fit onto my computer. It always falls off and I already see a chip."
"on December 29, 2016",not as pictured. The Apple signature does not show through.
"on July 14, 2017","I did not expect this, the bottom broke after three months and I'm really disappointed."
"on April 26, 2017",The case broke in not even 2 months. The case is not stable and cracks very easily.
"on August 12, 2017","Minor inconvenience but pretty disappointed. I previously had a Mosiso case for my Macbook Air and loved it. Unfortunately it was time to retire the old one as I had cracked one corner and the sticker non-slip feet had rubbed off and I did not have replacements. I could not stand my laptop sliding around on any surface I was working at so I quickly ordered another one. I got the neutral gray color which is lovely but the bottom half of the case fits slightly too large. No matter how I adjust it, its just ever so slightly running big on the bottom portion so the case scoots around a bunch and does not fit snug...Didn't have time to exchange before moving back to school and had already thrown away my old case so I just decided to live with it because I needed to protect my laptop for air travel. That being said...and I know its minor...but the slight shifting is super annoying especially since the grips don't really line up and there is a space gap...and however small the gap is it pretty much is an opening for dust, lint, etc. to fall in. Ugh. I paid a pretty price of $16.99 for the neutral gray color as opposed to the $13.99 or less for all other colors and got stuck with this shifty bottom case.Love mosiso, but this one was a dud."
"on February 5, 2018",She said it is very good.
"on July 30, 2017",this did not fit my laptop. had to return it.
"on March 25, 2017",The case does not clip on top and falls off. Have tried different ways of securing the case but it keeps falling off. Really disappointed.
"on November 16, 2017",It was too cheaply made even for its low price. Would only recommend for a stationary laptop.
"on September 25, 2017",it was scratched up when I received it and doesn't feel like a sturdy quality
"on November 27, 2017",The case breaks easily. It's only been 2 months and it's broken so is of no use any longer.
"on October 24, 2017",This product did NOT come with a keyboard cover!
"on August 4, 2017",The case says its for the MacBook Air 13 in. but it keeps falling off. super disappointed.
"on December 4, 2017",Followed instructions but the case cracked immediately during application.
"on June 7, 2017",This item Doesn't fit an Apple MacBook Air and it was broken upon arrival.
"on November 3, 2016",I purchased the red case and it doesn't fit! It is to small. I am very disappointed in this product
"on July 27, 2017",It's fully pink. Not rose gold in the slightest.
"on June 9, 2017","Very disappointed on the quality of this case, did not last very long."
"on September 20, 2017",This product is terrible and it's cheaply made.
"on November 15, 2017",The bottom half of the case got incredibly hot very quickly. Would not recommend :(
"on October 16, 2017",Weak. Brittle. Doesn't show the apple logo like it is advertised. Very disappointed
"on April 10, 2017",Very poorly made..the little clips what hold in the top part broke off and they barely held...Very disappointed.
"on September 13, 2017",I hate it! It is super hard to put on the computer and even harder to take it off!
"on March 19, 2017",The case didnt even fit my maxbook air!
"on October 4, 2017",No stars!  There was no screen protector or keyboard cover in the box I received!
"on March 28, 2017",Crappy Case. This case broke within two weeks of using it with zero drops. Don't buy.
"on October 19, 2017",It was the wrong size it's completely useless to me
"on January 1, 2018","THE CASE DOES NOT EVEN FIT MY LAPTOP ITS TOO SMALL, I WOULD LIKE A REFUND"
"on January 30, 2017","The key pad doesn't fit my laptop, but it said made for the model of my laptop"
"on February 9, 2018",Its not the color I ordered. It looks nothing like the picture
"on April 5, 2017",too big
"on January 11, 2017",Not a durable product. Case broke easily on a minor impact and does not provide good protection. More suitable for appearance and preventing scratches.

"on October 22, 2017",came chipped :(

"on October 16, 2017",Sucks and it does not match color at all. Don’t buy
"on February 5, 2017",Waste of money. Cover comes off every time you open the computer.
"on November 25, 2016","Love the color, it's what I expected. The top case was pretty difficult to put on but I assume that means it won't pop off unexpectedly. Pretty good case for the price you're getting.EDIT: Unfortunately only a week or so after this review, the clasps that held the top part on broke off, and yesterday the ones that held the bottom ones did. Now that only thing I have left is the keyboard mat."
"on February 23, 2017",Looks very cheap on a very expensive computer. Doesn't stay on.

"on February 19, 2017","The bottom never stayed on, and the top cracked within 2 days..."
"on February 8, 2017",Top cover did not fit correctly and gas cracked.
"on March 16, 2017",It's only been a few months and the cover is broken.
"on December 8, 2016","I would not recommend this case to anyone. It is not durable. One of the two pieces broke after a week. The company sent a new one and I was satisfied... until it broke again.If you use your laptop constantly (student, work, etc.) I would highly recommend a different case.I ended up just throwing away the case and went with a different company.The color is excellent and beautiful, but this case is not practical."
"on February 17, 2017","it broke on the day of arrival , i don't recommend it"
"on April 20, 2017",Broke within 2 months.
"on January 4, 2017",Bottom of the case does not fit
"on March 14, 2017",Product received was damaged
"on November 1, 2016","UPDATE: The top cover falls off every time I open my MacBook. I've had issues of this happening since I first received the cas, but now The plastic pieces that secure the case have actually broken off and the case is now useless. Expectations aside, this case appears to either be poor quality or not properly fitting for a MacBook Air.I was expecting a deep wine color, but got a more translucent cherry red. The case itself had some slight imperfections and the top component will come off with slight pressure.The screen protector is a nice add (why I purchased this over another brand), but don't use the plastic piece provided to smooth out the bubbles--it will scratch the protector. I'd simply use a credit card.Not bad, but I wish I would've purchased another brand to receive something closer to what I was expecting."
"on November 5, 2016","UPDATE: The case broke yesterday. I went to lift up my screen and one of the tabs snapped off. This is the worst fitting case I've ever owned. It shouldn't be this difficult to put on a laptop case. I have looked up videos and they all show an easy application process. I had to put my whole body weight on top of it to get the tabs to snap on. It has taken me over an hour and I also filed the tabs with a nail file to see if they would fit better. Overly frustrated and disappointed. Mosiso - 3 in 1 Macbook Air 13 Inch Soft-Skin Plastic Hard Case Cover & Keyboard Cover & Screen Protector for Macbook Air 13.3"" (Models: A1369 and A1466), Black"
"on August 31, 2017","I looked at the pictures people posted on the reviews and figured I would be getting something in pretty good condition. The case is nice but the bottom is kind of loose. Also, the tabs on the bottom are glued on in the wrong spots, only one is glued in the right area. Also the key pad protected has a scratch on it. It's very sloppy. I was expecting more but I guess you get what you pay for."
"on March 12, 2017",This didn't fit my mac apple for 2009 I have a mini and I thought it would fit but I was won't the color is beautiful for a pro that I am glad to report that it did fit for that computer but if you're like me that carries you're mini for everyday use then make sure you get the correct  measurements  because this cover for a Mac Pro not a 2009 mini
"on January 8, 2017","The top screen keeps falling off. I wish I could give this half of a star because the only thing I like is the color. Even the screen protector wont go on properly and I can't get the air bubbles out as well as the tabs leave an annoying paper mark. Also, the case makes the sound funny when you are tying to listen to music, youtube, Netflix, etc. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!"
"on November 22, 2016",This really sucks! NEVER even use the keyboard cover as it leaves terrible marks on the screen once the laptop is closed. The logo will not be visible as clearly as it is shown in the picture. I wonder if the seller is out of his mind to even sell such kind a screen guard which is actually a cheap film of plastic. A BIG THUMBS DOWN!! I'm never going to recommend this to anyone!!!!
"on July 14, 2017","Back piece and keyboard cover fit except the cover for front of computer I have 13"" retina MacBook Pro 💻"
"on December 9, 2016","I ordered the parking one and received the pep talk not acceptable and no option to return it, . . wasted money"
"on February 8, 2017",I did not receive the screen protector and the keyboard cover
"on April 30, 2017",Received broken. Waste of time. Don't buy.
"on January 4, 2017",Cracked already.  It looks cute.
"on October 28, 2016","I should have known better than to order a product in which virtually all of the positive reviews were from people who had received the item for free.  The product was garbage; cheap plastic computer cover that arrived defective, with a crack in one corner.  I immediately printed out the return label and will be sending the item right back as soon as the weekend is over.  What a waste of time and money."
"on October 3, 2016",I didn't fit my laptop
"on December 20, 2016",This is a Christmas gift there is no way to tell if there are any issues as of yet
"on April 22, 2017","Very disappointed for a product especially with such high reviews. I had high expectations for this case to at least come in the mail CLEAN, but also to at least FIT my new Mac Air!First of all, the case came in defected with visible white specks on the surface and I instantly notified the company about the damage I received. Little do you expect them to belittle your concerns, not give any form of replacement, and offer only a minor $2 refund!After I noticed the damage on the surface of my case, I tried brushing those minor details off to the side and tried putting the case on my new 13 inch MacAir. The bottom case fit perfectly, however I spent hours upon hours trying to fit the top part behind my screen. It would not budge to FIT the slightest bit! At one point, it would barely hang in there and the next, it would just plop right off..Save your money and buy your laptop case from an actual reliable company; this is absolutely ridiculous. Never again.."
"on January 27, 2017","Nice color, but bad quality!!! Got mine today and the corner is turned outwards. I put it on anyways but it makes a noise every time a open my laptop because it scrapes against the top lid. Also very scratchy to put on my lap because of this. :(Update: I tried to live with it and get used to it, but I very quickly realized that the sides are also very scratchy and it hurts every time I type. I've been wearing long sleeves to combat this, but I can still feel the scratchiness through my sleeves. I didn't even know this could be a problem! I have to buy a new one now... DONT BUY THIS."
"on February 11, 2017","This cover LOOKED gorgeous, and the color is exactly as depicted.  Everything about it was great until I put it on my MacBook Air and actually used it.  It fit well, but after just two weeks, the top shell's edge began crumbling off, and the side ""clips"" on the bottom part of the shell that attach it to the laptop broke off.  I am very disappointed with the poor quality of this cover.  The keyboard cover fits okay on the keys and is the only redeeming feature of this product."
"on August 4, 2017","Keyboard cover does not fit the keyboard, the letters are just enough off that it looks 3-d when it lights up and it makes me sick.  I contacted the seller twice and never got a response.  Piece of junk, terrible customer service.  I would just send it back but the screen cover part is fine, it's just the keyboard and I don't want to go through the hassle.  I also doubt I'd get my money back considering the seller can't even respond to emails."
"on May 19, 2017","This cover was purchased after verifying it was for the Macbook Air model I have. I tried to put the cover on several times without success, so checked online if anyone else had an issue installing it. There were enough instructions to know that I wasn't the only one having difficulty. After finally getting it attached, 2 low profile hooks along the front and back edges, I was impressed with how well it looked. But, after using it only occasionally at home, I picked it up and the cover was loose. I looked to see that the clip had fractured right off on one side, and the other showed cracking in the same place. The company says they will replace it, but then - nothing! Several attempts to contact them are replied to with empty promises and now, no answer at all."
"on December 26, 2017","HIGH KEY disappointed by this. This case it self is very flimsy, also it appears like it has oil stains or soemthing. I have tried dissenfecting it, using windex, any thing u could think of. For some reason the case does not appear to be brand new, it collects stains and the light color I guy does not help that. Overall very awe full, and the keyboard lining that came with was cheap as heck. Litterally a piece of plastic. My photo was taken after I just tried cleaning it, really don’t recommend this case."
"on August 1, 2017","I've ordered this item twice, now, and both times it has arrived broken. I'd return it, again, but by the the time I package it back up, it won't be worth the money spent. The bottom part of the case arrives cracked. The keyboard cover is literally dirty. I've tried cleaning it, but apparently it's stained. So disappointed."
"on December 24, 2017","I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift, when she opened it today, the top was dirty with a big black mark on it and yellow stains along the top. The underside of the top has dirt on it as well. The bottom  has dirt that is stuck to the edges on the inside, and the bottom is also stained, the plastic pieces are worn off and one looks like it's been removed and reglued on. There is also a chip on the bottom where it connects to the side of the computer. This product also didn't come with the keyboard cover, or the screen protector as shown."
"on July 7, 2017",I was so excited to buy this product because of it's gorgeous color. I've had this item for less than 2 months and the bottom part has already broken off. The keyboard cover slips off. The screen protector was useless. The top part is still on and doing well so I guess there is one star for that.
"on December 1, 2017","This is a very poorly crafted cover. I purchased it Nov. 1 and by Dec. 1, two of the clips holding the top cover on have cracked and it no longer stays on.  I haven't dropped or otherwise mishandled the MacBook.  It's just a terribly made offering."
"on January 31, 2017","Bought this case for my new Macbook Air and was so excited when it came in.However, the quality is less than I expected. The screen protector that came with it did not fully cover the screen so I decided not to use it. Additionally, the letters on the keyboard cover did not match up exactly, so I decided not to use it either.I was completely content with just using the case, as that is what I originally wanted. However, just a few days after I put the case on it started to crack around the bottom. Yesterday, less than two weeks after I put the case on, the cracks have broken through. I am really disappointed as I do not throw around my laptop. This is just was gentle usage and I expected more.I don't want to go to the hassle of returning because I do not want my laptop unprotected, but I am going to have to get a different case for it soon before the bottom completely falls apart."
"on December 29, 2017","I don't understand how you can charge someone $8.41 to return something worth $13.99? Absolutely unfair. If it doesn't fit, it you brought it by mistake, well get ready to lose 60% of your money trying to return it."
"on November 3, 2017",It’s very bad quality. It does not have a good grip of my laptop. My laptop was better off without the case. The bottom piece of the laptop was so loose I assumed this is nice I don’t have to worry about struggling to removing it but after a few months  pieces of very tiny rocks that got in was able to scratch the whole bottom and a few in the top edges. I take my laptop everywhere but it also didn’t come out it’s box until I got this case. I wouldn’t recommend this without a sleeve.
"on August 8, 2017","I ordered wine red and received a brownish colored case. It looks nothing like the photo. I've ordered a wine red computer sleeve from Mosiso before and that looks nothing like this brownish case. Wasn't worth the buy, I returned it."
"on October 12, 2017","Gets greasy quickly, some of the corners broke just putting them on my laptop. I do like the keyboard cover and screen protector though. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Wouldn't buy again. Bought both the pink and black case."
"on August 24, 2017","The case arrived with a large circle cut out around the Apple emblem, which looked awful. Either have no cut out, or do it like many other cases and make the cut out the same as the Apple emblem. I never used it, and was too busy to return it."
"on June 11, 2017","The top cover keeps falling off, and the keyboard cover doesn't fit very well. It also shows smudges really easily. I had high hopes based on some of the reviews but I am really disappointed. I did like the color but that is about it.UPDATE: It now has a crack (there's no reason for this) and it looks constantly dirty  - the smudges from the natural oils from my skin don't come off. I regret this purchase and I'm now looking for a new case."
"on October 25, 2017",This looked nice for about a day- the rose gold color rubbed off almost instantly and the keypad cover also rubbed off all over my fingers
"on June 11, 2017","UPDATE: DON'T BUY THIS. It never fit properly and after 3 months it has totally cracked and broken up. All of the positive reviews were probably created the first day and don't explain the long term quality.I just received this case today for my Mac Air and was disappointed because the top and bottom cover of the case has little black spots embedded in the plastic so they cannot be cleaned off. Also the quality seems a little shoddy it doesn't snap tight , it feels a little bit loose. The keyboard cover went on really nicely. but I would not recommend The product on the whole.The image on Amazon also looks like the cover has an Apple logo on it which it does not. That is the light shining from the Apple logo on your computer."
"on January 5, 2017",The rose gold color was very purply-pink and did not look good in my opinion. I would return however Amazon was going to charge me almost the full price of the case to return so I'm stuck with it. I'll look elsewhere for a true rose gold case.
"on January 31, 2018","Had a difficult time getting it on. The little edges that are supposed to keep the case attached to the laptop chipped off with only a few months of use. Now, the top part does not attach to the laptop anymore. Did not handle roughly and bits and pieces of the case have chipped. The white bumps on the bottom of the case lose its stickyness after a short time. Keyboard cover leaves a mark on screen and you have to frequently wipe it. Wash the keyboard cover and it still leaves almost of a dusty imprint. No problem with the screen protector. Very disappointed."
"on November 21, 2016",A bunch of junk!  Top piece that fits on the computer doesn't fit and slides off.
"on April 18, 2017","I just received this in the mail and I was so excited to put it on my Macbook Air. However, the top cover does not fit. The bottom snaps in perfectly but the top is too small and will not connect. I also cannot tell which way the top case is supposed to attach to my laptop as a lot of reviews reference there being three snaps on one side and two on the other but my case only has two snaps on each side."
"on December 25, 2017","The top piece keeps falling off, does not stay well."
"on December 7, 2017","It was great, but it broke less than two months later. Probably need to invest in something more expensive. Not happy."
"on December 12, 2017","Leaves hand prints and you have to be cleaning it consistently for it not to look nasty. Keyboard is flimsy, try to buy a different  brand."
"on March 27, 2017","Top of it broke after 1 month. The other side doesn't clamped on without the broken side. Not worth it. Should've just saved up for a $30 one. It's also not fingerprint proof, makes my laptop look dirty"
"on June 17, 2017","I was hopeful after reading reviews about this case. However, I got it in the mail maybe five minutes ago and the corner of the bottom case is already cracked. It is cheap plastic, and I am extremely disappointed with the fact that it came already damaged. This case is supposed to protect my laptop, but can't even stick on now because of the crack."
"on August 13, 2017","Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures. This is a thin, plastic snap on covering which will not protect your MacBook from much. The color is not as rich and deep as indicated, since it's  translucent. The top covering is held in place by tiny ridges, which fail to hold. Almost every time I open it, the cover comes off. The most potentially useful part is the keyboard cover.  I'm returning it, even though the postage might cost me half the price of it."
"on July 28, 2017","The only reason I gave this product one star was because before I took it out of the package the product was broken and missing a piece of the bottom half. I did love the keyboard cover, it looked so nice on my computer. Unfortunately, the important part of the product was not what I was expecting."
"on August 7, 2017",Bought this because I just bought my macbook air. not only did it not fit my macbook air model A1466 correctly but when trying to get the top and bottom off it scratched the computer. almost broke the screen trying to pry it off. very disappointed because the case was nice looking.
"on July 19, 2017","The top cover won't stay attached; I think the little clips on the side are too small and totally inefficient;  the screen protector did not fit, nor did it stick (basically useless) and the keyboard cover has ridges aroud each letter cover and makes it a bit awkward to type over the keys so I took it off."
"on June 1, 2017","I LOVED this at first and thought the color and quality were perfect! But after just a few weeks use, there are so many cracks and broken edges of the case. I take good care of my computer, but the quality of this case is terrible."
"on November 16, 2017",Does NOT fit 2017 MacBook Air. Case snaps and bends when opening the lid. Hinge is blocked by the case.
"on February 23, 2017","I bought this case before buying new Macbook air 13"". Finally, I got the new Macbook today, and I was so excited to cover my new macbook with this case. However, it DOES NOT fit!!!! The upper part does not fit my macbook air 13"" at all! I tried to fit the case on my macbook by pushing hard, but it does not work! I'm curious they sold me the right case for macbook air 13""."
"on August 3, 2017",This cover had a defect or was used when I received it. It had a visible blue mark on the front cover I had to return it.But the cover fit was perfectly & the material was really nice.
"on December 6, 2017","I have had this case for a week and it has already begun to crack. The bottom portion of the case no longer stays on because the only two pieces of plastic holding it on have fallen off. I'll admit, the price and features of this product where initially appealing, but I've found that you really do get what you pay for."
"on April 19, 2017","The case fit fine but broke after hardly any use. The plastic is very malleable, and the small pieces which are meant to clasp on to the laptop all broke off one by one. The bottom pieces had all broken off after only 3 weeks, so the bottom piece wouldn't stay on at all. The same thing happened with the top piece."
"on April 11, 2017","The description of this item is inaccurate. The case is not see through as you can see in the picture. The case is dark which is not what you see in the picture. I realized after I opened the package, otherwise I would return."
"on March 3, 2017",Does not stay on computer - actually the top doesn't even clip on to begin with - you'll save money if buy a better case.  I have to buy a replacement because my son put stickers on it before he tried to put it on his computer. Can't return.  I bought the black case.
"on December 7, 2016","This product only looks good. The cover on top would not fix right on my Macbook Air. Now, within a week the top has cracked. No impact nothing happened. This is extremely brittle and fragile. Wonder what the manufacturer has to say about this.I would never recommend this to anyone."
"on September 14, 2017",Updated review: I’ve used it less than 1 month and the bottom part has already broken off!!!!
"on August 10, 2017","Too shinny, just touch it and you will leave your fingerprints on it.  Definitely It was totally disappointed."
"on December 3, 2017","I bought one in the gold color, the cover came scratched and when I put it in the MacBook  it didn’t  fit well. In the ""apple"" part when the computer is on, shows how bad quality is the product, the ink has several faults! Returning right now"
"on April 10, 2017",I love the color and how everything is but: The screen protector did not fit nicely and had to be taken off as soon as I put it on. The top shell cracked within the first month. And the bottom shell started to crack within two months. Want my refund. Do not buy this product.
"on January 12, 2018","I have had this case for a few weeks now, and the clips that attach have broken off, leaving not only parts of my computer uncovered but also making it so the case doesn't stay on properly. Would not recommend to anyone."
"on August 30, 2017","I bought this in rose gold a few months ago and it cracked after a week and has continued to crack even more so since then. I received a partial refund, but don't bother wasting your money. You get what you pay for."
"on December 1, 2016","case barely fits mac book air, it's too big. The bottom piece does not fit with the laptop, and the screen protector was horrible. The screen protector was too small for the screen and had too many bubbles. Do not buy it."
"on October 18, 2017",I ve recived caae today! But it’s already  broken
"on December 14, 2016","Bought this case for my new MacBook Air and the top half of the case wouldn't snap onto the laptop. I tried a bunch of times, had others try, and it just didn't fit. Returning it..."
"on November 9, 2017","This case does not show the apple at all. Online it looks like you can see it through the case, but you cannot, even when the laptop is on and the apple is lit up."
"on April 6, 2017",I was disappointed that the apple logo was not cut out & the keyboard lights dnt go through the keyboard skin 😭😭
"on January 20, 2017","Shell was very nice and screen protector came and arrived fairly quickly. however, I have a MacBook Air 13.3 in and this case doesn't fit it. I'm not sure if it was made for an older version of air, but its too small for mine so I have to return it."
"on July 20, 2017","Would not recommend. I bought this based on stellar reviews. Mine arrived scratched in several places with tape stuck to both the top and bottom pieces.  In addition, it doesn't fit correctly. There is a gap between the top piece and the top of the computer.  When the Apple illuminates it's blurry and doesn't look like an Apple.I guess you get what you pay for. I think this one was used and they just wrapped it up and sent it back out.I am very disappointed."
"on December 30, 2017","On the picture it has a picture of an apple and the actual cover doesn’t have that. I couldn’t tell which was the screen protector because they were both weird looking and there were no directions, the top piece of the cover fit well on the monitor but the bottom piece would slide every time I opened and closed it. The cover on the letters was so cute! But it didn’t stick at all ): the color was really nice but i would never use it on my computer sadly. Never have returned anything on amazon, this would be a first. I wouldn’t buy"
"on April 17, 2017","This thing is so bad. Doesn't stay on the mac book , the clips are not sturdy and broke almost immediately and just is all around a terrible case"
"on June 26, 2017",Cheap made
"on December 27, 2016",I was unable to make this cover fit. I could only lock in 3 of the 4 tabs to attach the top. I have returned this Case to Amazon.
"on August 24, 2017",I got a wrong order instead of 13 inch I received a 15 inch case for my macbook.
"on November 14, 2017",Doesn’t fit as discribed
"on November 1, 2017",fell apart within a month. cheap
"on November 17, 2017",HORRIBLE. Came with a crack.
"on June 6, 2017",this case lasted me a WEEK
"on November 23, 2017",wrong size
"on December 2, 2017",It's not 13 inches!!!
"on August 20, 2016",Does not fit my MacBook Pro 13' inch at all..
"on August 31, 2017","If I can give zero stars, I would!!!!!! Doesn't fit my laptop and it looks very breakable..."
"on August 28, 2017",Cheap and doesn't protect your computer AT ALL.
